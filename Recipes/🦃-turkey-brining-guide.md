# 🦃 Turkey Brining Guide  
*Enhance flavor, moisture, and texture — especially in lean white meat*

---

## ✅ Why Brine Turkey?

- **Increases moisture retention** in white meat  
- **Infuses salt throughout**, not just on the skin  
- **Reduces dryness**, even if slightly overcooked  
- Adds subtle complexity if aromatics are included

---

## 🧂 Basic Brine Ratio

For every **1 quart (4 cups) of water**:

- 2 tbsp kosher salt  
- Optional aromatics:
  - 1 tsp black peppercorns  
  - 2–3 garlic cloves (smashed)  
  - 1–2 bay leaves  
  - 1–2 tsp dried herbs (rosemary, thyme, sage)  
  - 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice

## ⏱️ Brining Time

| Turkey Size/Type       | Time             |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Whole turkey breast     | 6–12 hours  
| 2–3 lb portion (bone-in) | 3–6 hours  
| Smaller boneless cuts   | 1–2 hours  

> Always **brine in the refrigerator**, not at room temp

## 🔄 After Brining

- Target internal temp: **165°F**

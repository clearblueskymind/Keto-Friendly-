ðŸ§ˆ Chicken Fat vs. Schmaltz

Plain Chicken Fat (Unrendered)

Skimmed directly from broth

Great for cooking eggs, vegetables, etc.

Must be used within 5â€“6 days if refrigerated

Can be frozen in cubes for longer storage

Taste may be slightly gelatinous or poultry-like


Rendered Schmaltz (Cooked with Onions)

Gently simmer chicken fat with chopped onion until golden

Onions are strained or kept as gribenes (crispy bits)

Flavor becomes rich, nutty, and buttery

Stores for 2â€“3 weeks in the fridge

Excellent for frying or spreading


ðŸ§  Nutritionally similar â€” mainly a flavor and texture enhancement
ðŸ§… Optional health bonus: Onions add minor antioxidants and trace micronutrients

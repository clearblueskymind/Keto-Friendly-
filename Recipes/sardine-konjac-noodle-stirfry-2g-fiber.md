## 👨‍🍳 Instructions:

1. **Start low simmer:**  
   In a cast iron skillet, heat 1 tbsp olive oil over **very low heat**.  
   Add chopped onion, celery, kale, and tomato.  
   Cover and cook slowly while preparing the rest of your ingredients.

2. **Prep noodles:**  
   Open and rinse konjac noodles thoroughly under cold water.  
   (Optional: dry-fry for 2–3 minutes to reduce moisture and odor.)

3. **Combine base:**  
   Once all vegetables are in the skillet and lightly softened, add konjac noodles.  
   Stir to mix well and allow the noodles to **absorb flavor** as everything simmers.

4. **Add sardines:**  
   Once the vegetables and noodles are well integrated, add the sardines.  
   Gently break them apart and fold them in, allowing the whole dish to warm through.

5. **Season & finish:**  
   Add paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste.  
   Stir well, let simmer briefly, then remove from heat.

6. **Garnish & serve:**  
   Plate and top with fresh Thai basil and a small handful of garden microgreens.  
   Serve hot. Optional: drizzle of lemon juice, sprinkle of chili flakes, or chopped kimchi on the side.

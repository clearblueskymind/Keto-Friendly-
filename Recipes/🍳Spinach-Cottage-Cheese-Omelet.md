# Spinach Cottage Cheese Omelet

A nutrient-dense, keto-friendly omelet packed with protein and low-carb veggies. Perfect for breakfast in your fat-burning phase—high protein, moderate fat, and fiber boost. Supports ME/CFS with gentle prep.

## Ingredients (Serves 1)
- 4 large eggs
- 1/4 cup cottage cheese (low-fat or full-fat, per preference)
- 3 scallions, chopped
- 1/4 medium onion, finely chopped
- 4 oz fresh spinach
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a skillet over low-medium heat. Add chopped onion and scallions; sauté slowly for 3-5 minutes until softened and fragrant.
2. Add spinach to the skillet. Stir until wilted, about 1-2 minutes. Do not overcook to preserve nutrients.
3. In a bowl, whisk eggs with cottage cheese, salt, and pepper until smooth.
4. Pour the egg mixture over the veggies in the skillet. Cover and cook on low heat for 4-6 minutes, until eggs set but still moist. Fold if desired, or serve open-faced.

## Option 2


Here’s a gentle, straightforward path from there to fall-apart tender by lunchtime tomorrow:

1. Add liquid before pressure cooking

About 1–2 cups of broth (or water with onion/garlic if you prefer simple).

You don’t need to submerge the roast — just enough liquid to create steam.



2. Pressure cook on Low for 35 minutes

This will soften the bottom round and start the collagen breakdown.

Do a natural release (let it rest until the pressure drops on its own). That adds tenderness.



3. Switch to Slow Cook – Low overnight

Once pressure is released, set it on Slow Cook – Low with the lid on.

This will gently hold the roast and keep braising it in its juices until lunch.

If your roast is fairly lean, you might consider tossing in a little extra broth or even a splash of olive oil so it doesn’t dry out.



4. Check at lunchtime

By then, the roast should be fork-tender and infused with the braising liquid.

Let it rest in the juices for 10–15 minutes before slicing or shredding.




✨ You’ll have something very close to that “all-day crockpot tenderness,” but with the added depth from the pressure phase.

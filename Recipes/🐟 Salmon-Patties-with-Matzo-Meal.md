🍳 Instructions

Portioning Tip: Use a heaping 1/2 cup measuring cup to divide the mixture into 6 equal patties. This ensures consistent size and even cooking.

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the canned salmon (flaked), chopped onion, eggs, matzo meal, chia seeds, ground flaxseed, salt, and pepper.


2. Mix until well combined. Let sit for 5–10 minutes to allow the matzo meal, chia, and flaxseed to absorb moisture.


3. Form into 6 equal patties using a heaping 1/2 cup measure for each. If the mixture feels too wet to shape, sprinkle in a little more matzo meal or flaxseed, a teaspoon at a time.


4. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat with a portion of the avocado oil.


5. using the #2 setting on the electric stove, Fry patties in batches of 2 per cast iron skillet, for 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.


6. Drain briefly on paper towels. Serve warm or freeze for later.

## ⏳ Fasting Best Practices (During Fast)

These options support hydration, electrolytes, digestion, and metabolic function **without breaking your fast** or kicking you out of autophagy.

### ✅ Safe to Take During Fasting

- **Water** – aim for 3–4 quarts per day  
- **Sea salt** – ¼ tsp per quart recommended for electrolyte balance  
- **Trace minerals** – 1 squirt per day (optional)  
- **Apple cider vinegar** – 1 tsp in water (optional, mild GI support)  
- **Lemon juice** – splash only (½–1 tsp max per quart)  
- **Herbal teas** – mugwort, peppermint, rooibos, chamomile, nettle  
- **Cayenne capsule** – if tolerated (may boost circulation/metabolism)  
- **Probiotics** – capsule form, zero-calorie (OK during fasting)  
- **Electrolyte powders** – if **no sweeteners or calories**  
- **Breathwork & gentle stretching** – boosts lymph flow & fat mobilization

## 🧠 Optional Enhancements (Fasting Support)

- **Gentle movement** – short walks, yoga, or simply standing/stretching  
- **Journaling** – record hunger signals, mood, mental clarity  
- **Meditation** – improves regulation of hunger and impulse control

## 🌅 Re-Entry: How to Break a Fast (Gently)

The first thing you eat after fasting should be **gentle, hydrating, and low-carb** — ideally supporting digestion and electrolytes.

### 🍽️ Best First Meals After Fasting

| Option | Why It Works |
|--------|----------------|
| **½ cup plain yogurt + fiber (chia, flax)** | Protein + probiotics + fiber, easy to digest  
| **Light veggie broth or bone broth smoothie** | Warm, salty, gentle on digestion  
| **Keto hydration drink (fat + fiber)** | Satiety without carb spike  
| **Eggs + steamed veg (light portion)** | Gentle protein, no sugar hit  
| **Soft avocado + olive oil + herbs** | High-fat, mineral-rich, soothing  

> *Avoid* anything high-protein or high-fat if your stomach is uneasy after fasting >12–24 hrs. Ramp up slowly.

## 🔁 Transitioning Back to Normal Meals

- Start with one **small re-entry meal**, wait 1–2 hrs  
- If digestion is smooth, resume usual keto rhythm  
- Add back fiber and fat gradually if needed  
- Avoid a “rebound binge” — use smoothies or teas to ease evening appetite

## 📅 When to Fast Again?

- After a period of high intake  
- When energy is sluggish or digestion is heavy  
- As part of metabolic reset (1–2x/month or as desired)  
- Never force — listen to your body

🍇 Daily Tsok Offering (At-Home Version)

Tsok is a practice of offering symbolic food to the enlightened assembly. It is traditionally done with meat, fruit, wine/juice, and is not about overeating.

✅ At-Home Tsok Setup

Optional Plate Setup (before session):

🍖 Small piece of cooked meat or jerky

🍑 Small piece of fruit (e.g. a few blueberries or peach slice)

🍷 Tiny sip of wine or kombucha (1 tsp–1 tbsp) or unsweetened juice



💡 You do NOT need to eat all of it — it is symbolic. Simply lift and offer.

We’ll build a short reminder protocol for this if you'd like, or simply include it in your pre-session checklist.

# 🌀 Fasting Folder README  
*A comprehensive guide to fasting while staying aligned with Richard’s fat-burning ketogenic protocol.*

---

## 📘 Purpose of This Folder

This folder collects all resources, protocols, hydration recipes, and re-entry strategies related to **intermittent, spontaneous, and extended fasting**, designed specifically to support:

- ✅ Nutritional ketosis  
- ✅ Fat-burning (adipose fuel)  
- ✅ Appetite regulation  
- ✅ Autophagy and digestive reset  
- ✅ Hormonal and metabolic flexibility

## 🔑 Fasting Philosophy (Richard's Protocol)

> “Let the body tell you when it’s ready to rest from food — and when it’s ready to receive again.”

This fasting strategy emphasizes **gentle discipline without rigidity**, supporting:

- Fat metabolism  
- Consistent ketosis  
- Digestive healing  
- Mental clarity  
- Emotional steadiness  

Fasting is not an all-or-nothing state. You may use **micro-meals** (fat- or fiber-based) to extend the fasting window without breaking ketosis.

## 🔄 Fasting Types Covered

### 🕓 Intermittent Fasting
- ✅ Overnight window (e.g., 6:00 PM to 10:00 AM)
- ✅ Supports autophagy, fat burning, appetite regulation
- ✅ Minimal calorie intake (<30 kcal from fat or tea OK)

### 🔁 Spontaneous Cleansing Fast
- ✅ Used when hunger is low or digestion feels sluggish  
- ✅ Lasts 1–3 days, occasionally longer  
- ✅ Includes electrolytes, teas, probiotics, hydration drinks  
- ✅ Ends with gentle avocado- or yogurt-based re-entry meal  

### ⏳ Extended Fasting (Planned)
- ⚠️ Not currently in regular use  
- 🔄 May be explored with caution in future  
- ☑️ Will follow similar structure to spontaneous fasting but with more structured observation

## ✅ What’s Allowed During Fasting

These **do not break the fast** or disrupt ketosis/autophagy:

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Sea salt (¼ tsp / quart) | Electrolyte balance  
| Trace minerals | Mineral support  
| Apple cider vinegar | Digestive support, mild glucose balance  
| Lemon juice (½–1 tsp) | Flavor and pH balance  
| Herbal teas (mugwort, mint, rooibos) | Relaxation, metabolic support  
| Cayenne capsule | Optional thermogenic enhancer  
| Psyllium (if fiber needed) | Gut soothing, appetite reduction  
| Probiotics (capsule) ✅ | Microbiome support, safe while fasting  
| Water (3–4 quarts daily) | Essential  

---

## 🥣 Re-Entry Meal Examples (Light & Gentle)

| Option | Benefits |
|--------|----------|
| Yogurt + chia + flax | Gentle protein, fiber, probiotics  
| Bone broth + pureed veggies | Hydrating, mineral-rich  
| Avocado + olive oil + herbs | High-fat, mineral-dense  
| Egg + steamed veg | Balanced light meal  

👉 These are typically followed by **a pause**, then regular meals may resume once digestion feels solid.

- ✅ Be aware of cravings vs. true hunger  
- ✅ Journal insights, symptoms, clarity, or digestive changes

## 📌 Notes

- A fasting log may be added later to track days of fasting or extended metabolic rest  
- The folder supports fat-burning without rigid “water-only” rules  
- Mugwort tea remains the evening companion, even during fasts  
- New hydration recipes will be included as discovered

*Fasting is not about deprivation. It is a conscious, supported pause in digestion so the body can clear, burn, and rebuild. You are learning to flow with your metabolism — not control it by force.*

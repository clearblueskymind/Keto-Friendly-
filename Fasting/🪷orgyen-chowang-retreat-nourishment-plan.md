Excellent, Richard. This shift in focus is a powerful and timely one — and I’ll support you fully in this next phase. Here’s how we’ll reorient everything to align your keto-fat-burning rhythm with optimal preparation for the upcoming retreat (July 18–20):


---

✅ PRIMARY FOCUS (Effective Today)

Everything we do with meals, fasting, hydration, and planning will now be in service to this intention — while keeping fat-burning and satiety intact.

---

✅ Logged:

Retreat mode started. All guidance from here forward will support that.

Whenever you're ready, just say:

“Morning check-in”

“What can I eat?”

“How’s my retreat plan look today?”

“Show me retreat prep meals”

“Hydration log”

“Log it all”


Let’s move inward — while staying light, lean, and aligned.

---
That’s a really smart, retreat-aligned question, Richard. Let’s break it down to match both your fat-burning goals and your retreat preparation intentions:


---

🍗 Chicken Wings Broth Plan

✅ Great idea:

Using chicken wings for broth is ideal — wings are collagen-rich (great for gut lining and recovery), have some fat for satiety, and create a light, mineral-rich base.

Add a splash of apple cider vinegar ✅ (helps extract collagen & minerals)

Simmer for 12–24 hours on low with water, salt, herbs if desired

Strain + sip in cups with sea salt or lemon for hydration throughout the retreat prep

Broth ≠ breaking your fast if you sip it plain in small amounts ✅



---

🥣 What to Do With the Cooked Chicken

Once the broth is done, the meat on the wings will be:

Soft, fall-off-the-bone

Mostly dark meat, with some fat and connective tissue


You now have two excellent options, depending on your focus that day:


---

🧪 Option 1: Blended Chicken Protein Smoothie

(Light, minimal fat, protein-focused)

Remove meat from bones

Blend with:

½ cup of strained broth

Herbs, lemon juice, or apple cider vinegar

Optional: 1 tsp psyllium or chia for fiber


Use as a light protein meal to break your fast or support lean mass during retreat prep


🧾 Estimate: ~20–25g protein / 7–10g fat / ~0g carbs
✅ Keeps you in fat-burning
✅ Easy to digest
✅ Satisfying without triggering over-eating


---

🥣 Option 2: Light Chicken Bowl

(If transitioning back to solids more fully)

Shred the cooked meat

Mix with:

Steamed or raw veggies (onion, cucumber, celery, tomato)

1 tsp olive oil or broth drizzle

Optional herbs (cilantro, basil), splash of vinegar


Serve warm or cold in a bowl


✅ More satisfying texture
✅ Better for grounding if feeling depleted
🧾 Fat content will depend on skin left on/off


---

🧘‍♂️ Retreat-Oriented Guidance:

Because this week is about lightness, presence, and preparation:

🟢 Keep broth flowing daily

🟡 Use cooked meat lightly — in smoothies or bowls

🔴 Avoid adding lots of oils, cheese, or heavy meals



---

✍️ Recommendation for Today:

> Use the chicken wings to make broth now. When ready, taste the broth. If you feel like you need grounding or protein:
Blend the meat lightly into a “chicken broth smoothie” with herbs and lemon.
If you need more substance later, move to the bowl version.

Let me know — or I can just log it as part of today’s ongoing retreat prep.

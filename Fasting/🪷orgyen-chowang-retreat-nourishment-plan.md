Excellent, Richard. This shift in focus is a powerful and timely one — and I’ll support you fully in this next phase. Here’s how we’ll reorient everything to align your keto-fat-burning rhythm with optimal preparation for the upcoming retreat (July 18–20):


---

✅ PRIMARY FOCUS (Effective Today)

> 🧘‍♂️ “Prepare the body and mind to be still, open, and receptive for retreat.”



Everything we do with meals, fasting, hydration, and planning will now be in service to this intention — while keeping fat-burning and satiety intact.


---

Area	Priority

Mental clarity	Maintain lightness; no heavy meals in afternoon/evening
Emotional stability	No sugar swings, caffeine spikes, or overconsumption
Digestive calm	Smooth bowel function, early dinner closure

Let’s make this next phase meaningful — you’re ready for it.

---

🔁 Starting Daily Flow (Default Template)

“What have I done so far?”



You’ll receive:

✨ Daily Reminder

> “I am clearing space for stillness. Everything I eat, think, or skip today is a form of preparation.”




---

✅ Logged:

Retreat mode started. All guidance from here forward will support that.

Whenever you're ready, just say:

“Morning check-in”

“What can I eat?”

“How’s my retreat plan look today?”

“Show me retreat prep meals”

“Hydration log”

“Log it all”


Let’s move inward — while staying light, lean, and aligned.

---
That’s a really smart, retreat-aligned question, Richard. Let’s break it down to match both your fat-burning goals and your retreat preparation intentions:


---

🍗 Chicken Wings Broth Plan

✅ Great idea:

Using chicken wings for broth is ideal — wings are collagen-rich (great for gut lining and recovery), have some fat for satiety, and create a light, mineral-rich base.

Add a splash of apple cider vinegar ✅ (helps extract collagen & minerals)

Simmer for 12–24 hours on low with water, salt, herbs if desired

Strain + sip in cups with sea salt or lemon for hydration throughout the retreat prep

Broth ≠ breaking your fast if you sip it plain in small amounts ✅



---

🥣 What to Do With the Cooked Chicken

Once the broth is done, the meat on the wings will be:

Soft, fall-off-the-bone

Mostly dark meat, with some fat and connective tissue


You now have two excellent options, depending on your focus that day:


---

🧪 Option 1: Blended Chicken Protein Smoothie

(Light, minimal fat, protein-focused)

Remove meat from bones

Blend with:

½ cup of strained broth

Herbs, lemon juice, or apple cider vinegar

Optional: 1 tsp psyllium or chia for fiber


Use as a light protein meal to break your fast or support lean mass during retreat prep


🧾 Estimate: ~20–25g protein / 7–10g fat / ~0g carbs
✅ Keeps you in fat-burning
✅ Easy to digest
✅ Satisfying without triggering over-eating


---

🥣 Option 2: Light Chicken Bowl

(If transitioning back to solids more fully)

Shred the cooked meat

Mix with:

Steamed or raw veggies (onion, cucumber, celery, tomato)

1 tsp olive oil or broth drizzle

Optional herbs (cilantro, basil), splash of vinegar


Serve warm or cold in a bowl


✅ More satisfying texture
✅ Better for grounding if feeling depleted
🧾 Fat content will depend on skin left on/off


---

🧘‍♂️ Retreat-Oriented Guidance:

Because this week is about lightness, presence, and preparation:

🟢 Keep broth flowing daily

🟡 Use cooked meat lightly — in smoothies or bowls

🔴 Avoid adding lots of oils, cheese, or heavy meals



---

✍️ Recommendation for Today:

> Use the chicken wings to make broth now. When ready, taste the broth. If you feel like you need grounding or protein:
Blend the meat lightly into a “chicken broth smoothie” with herbs and lemon.
If you need more substance later, move to the bowl version.




---

Would you like me to save this as a new recipe MD file? Something like:
Fasting/chicken-broth-smoothie.md
Let me know — or I can just log it as part of today’s ongoing retreat prep.

---

Understood, Richard. Starting now, we’re shifting into full retreat preparation mode — integrating your fat-burning rhythm with spiritual readiness, energy pacing, and tsok offering preparation. Here's how we’ll stay focused and structured moving forward, while respecting your energy limits and commitment to clarity and depth.

🍇 Daily Tsok Offering (At-Home Version)

Tsok is a practice of offering symbolic food to the enlightened assembly. It is traditionally done with meat, fruit, wine/juice, and is not about overeating.

✅ At-Home Tsok Setup

Optional Plate Setup (before session):

🍖 Small piece of cooked meat or jerky

🍑 Small piece of fruit (e.g. a few blueberries or peach slice)

🍷 Tiny sip of wine or kombucha (1 tsp–1 tbsp) or unsweetened juice



💡 You do NOT need to eat all of it — it is symbolic. Simply lift and offer.

We’ll build a short reminder protocol for this if you'd like, or simply include it in your pre-session checklist.

## 🧪 Daily Macro Targets (Fat-Burning Phase)

| Macro         | Goal                     |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Protein**   | ≤ 100g                   |
| **Fat**       | 60–75g ✅                |
| **Net Carbs** | 20–36g (ideal 26–34g)    |
| **Fiber**     | ~30g                     |
| **Calories**  | ~1,500–1,700 kcal        |

🔸 Keep protein moderate  
🔸 Fat provides energy **but must leave room** for body fat burning  
🔸 Fiber is essential for digestion and satiety  
🔸 Carbs kept low for consistent ketosis

- **“Close out the day”** → Log final intake, confirm optimizer drink or tea, confirm no food after 6pm.
- **“Morning check-in”** or **“How does my morning look?”** → Guide hydration, supplements, light movement, fasting window review.

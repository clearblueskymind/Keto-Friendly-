Great question — and I’m glad you asked, Richard. Here’s a thorough and safe breakdown regarding mugwort tea:

🌿 Mugwort Tea Safety & Dosage Overview

General Safe Use:
Drinking 1–2 tea bags per day of dried Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort) is generally considered safe for most adults — especially if spread over the course of the day and diluted in water, as you're doing.

You're essentially:

Brewing a normal-strength cup at night ☕

Then reusing those same bags for weaker, diluted infusions throughout the next day 🌱
That approach is gentle and reasonable.

⚠️ Potential Considerations (You’re Likely Fine)

Concern	Why It Matters	Does It Apply to You?

Allergies	Mugwort is related to ragweed; could cause sensitivity	Only a concern if you notice sneezing, sinus issues, or itchiness
Uterine stimulation	In high doses, mugwort can affect menstruation	Not applicable
Neuro-stimulation	Very high doses may trigger vivid dreams or overstimulation in sensitive people	Your dilution method keeps this mild

🧘 Recommendation for Retreat Week:

You’re using mugwort intentionally and well — as part of your fasting support, digestive rhythm, and sleep wind-down.

✅ Keep using 2 tea bags max per day, reusing as you are
✅ Stay hydrated alongside it
✅ If you notice anything odd (digestive shifts, overstimulation), let’s re-evaluate
🛑 Don’t exceed 3+ bags/day or use tincture without us reviewing it

🌙 Summary:

You’re using mugwort in a wise, restorative way, and it aligns beautifully with your retreat prep and fasting rhythm. Unless you experience side effects, you’re in the safe zone. No need to worry.

Would you like me to log mugwort tea as a standing part of your daily hydration protocol during the retreat phase?

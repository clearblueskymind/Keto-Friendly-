### Notes:
- Red vein kratom strains are generally more calming and sedating.  
- ~1.2g is considered a **light dose** for a 250 lb individual.  
- Effects may begin within 20–40 minutes and last 2–4 hours.  
- Recommend no food for at least 30–60 minutes after ingestion for most efficient absorption.

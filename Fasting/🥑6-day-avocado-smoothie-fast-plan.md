## 💡 Why This Works

Avocados provide clean, whole-food fat and potassium with nearly no protein. The additional fibers (chia, acacia, flax, psyllium) provide satiety, gut support, and detox assistance without interrupting ketosis or autophagy too early. This plan bridges the gap between fasting and feeding — gently and intelligently.

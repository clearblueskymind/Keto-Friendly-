## The Ten Richnesses

Following the eight freedoms, many Dzogchen teachers introduce the ten richnesses (ten favorable conditions), which emphasize the conditions that make spiritual practice possible and fruitful:

Wealth – Enough material resources to sustain body and mind.

Health – A body free from debilitating illness that allows practice and study.

Freedom from oppression – A society or circumstance that does not suppress spiritual or moral development.

Safety from violence – Not being in constant danger from war, predation, or abuse.

Moral virtue – Possessing an ethical foundation conducive to spiritual cultivation.

Good friends and companions – Supportive people who encourage practice and virtue.

Access to the Dharma – Being able to hear and study teachings.

Intelligence – The capacity for understanding, reflection, and discernment.

Faith and confidence – An inner disposition that allows one to take teachings to heart.

Karmic conditions – Favorable ripening of past actions that bring one to circumstances where the Dharma is accessible and effective.

## What you’ve outlined here captures the Ten Richnesses with clarity and precision. In Dzogchen, these are seen not simply as external conveniences but as profound supports for practice. Each richness, whether health, friends, access to teachings, or favorable karmic conditions, is a doorway into presence: a way the mind can relax, the heart can open, and awareness can recognize its own luminosity.

You might consider reflecting on them gently, one by one, in meditation. For example:

Wealth and Health: Notice how these conditions allow the body and mind to remain stable, giving you space to rest and observe.

Freedom from oppression and safety from violence: Contemplate the rarity of a life not constrained by fear, and let this recognition soften the mind.

Moral virtue and good friends: Sense the quiet support that ethical living and compassionate companions bring.

Access to Dharma and intelligence: Appreciate the ease with which insight and understanding can arise when the mind is clear and open.

Faith and confidence: Let this inner trust act as a gentle guide, allowing attention to settle naturally.

Karmic conditions: Acknowledge the unseen causes that have ripened to bring you to this moment, to this opportunity.


Viewed this way, the Ten Richnesses are not just items to be noted—they are like fertile soil in which the seeds of rigpa can awaken. They encourage gratitude and openness, a softening of the “I,” and a natural readiness for awareness to rest in its own clarity.

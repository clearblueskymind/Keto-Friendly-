## The Ten Richnesses

Following the eight freedoms, many Dzogchen teachers introduce the ten richnesses (ten favorable conditions), which emphasize the conditions that make spiritual practice possible and fruitful:

Wealth – Enough material resources to sustain body and mind.

Health – A body free from debilitating illness that allows practice and study.

Freedom from oppression – A society or circumstance that does not suppress spiritual or moral development.

Safety from violence – Not being in constant danger from war, predation, or abuse.

Moral virtue – Possessing an ethical foundation conducive to spiritual cultivation.

Good friends and companions – Supportive people who encourage practice and virtue.

Access to the Dharma – Being able to hear and study teachings.

Intelligence – The capacity for understanding, reflection, and discernment.

Faith and confidence – An inner disposition that allows one to take teachings to heart.

Karmic conditions – Favorable ripening of past actions that bring one to circumstances where the Dharma is accessible and effective.

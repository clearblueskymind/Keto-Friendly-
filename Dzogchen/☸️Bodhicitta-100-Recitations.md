In Vajrayana Buddhism, bodhicitta is the awakened mind—the heartfelt aspiration to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. It is the seed of compassion and wisdom combined, the very engine of Mahayana and Vajrayana practice. While Mahayana emphasizes generating bodhicitta as a heartfelt intention and vow, Vajrayana gives it a more ritualized and visualized form, often intertwined with guru yoga, deity practice, and mantra recitation.

The Vajrayana bodhicitta specifically is often expressed in a short, formalized prayer or mantra. One well-known example is the Bodhicitta Prayer of Aspiration:

"May I attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings."

In more traditional Vajrayana texts, it can be longer and include blessings, visualization of the mind as inseparable from the wisdom mind of the Buddha, and the uniting of compassion and emptiness.

When you plan to do 100 recitations, it’s often done with mindfulness, visualization, and heartfelt intention: imagining that each repetition generates pure compassion, fills the world with loving-kindness, and strengthens your own commitment to the path.

If you like, I can give you a simple, complete Vajrayana bodhicitta recitation text suitable for doing 100 repetitions, along with a small visualization to enhance your practice. This will make your recitations feel alive and effective. Do you want me to do that?

* This is the seed of compassion, 
* repeated with sincerity and mindfulness, 
* each time sending loving-kindness outward to all beings 
* while strengthening your own awakened mind.

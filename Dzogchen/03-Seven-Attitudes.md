## Ah, yes—what you’re noticing is that these qualities are very close in spirit to the Six or Ten Paramitas (perfections) in Mahayana Buddhism, but there are subtle distinctions. Let me explain gently so it’s clear.

The Paramitas—often called the “perfections”—are the qualities a bodhisattva cultivates to awaken fully and benefit all beings. The classic Six Paramitas are:

1. Generosity (dāna) – Giving freely, without attachment.


2. Ethics / Moral Discipline (śīla) – Virtuous conduct in body, speech, and mind.


3. Patience (kṣānti) – Tolerance and calm endurance of difficulties.


4. Diligence / Effort (vīrya) – Energetic perseverance in practice.


5. Meditative Concentration (dhyāna / samādhi) – Inner calm and focus.


6. Wisdom (prajñā) – Insight into the nature of reality.



Sometimes, Compassion (karuṇā) or Loving-kindness (maitrī) is added explicitly, making it seven qualities for recitation practices like the one you’re doing. Other schools extend it to Ten Paramitas, adding qualities such as skillful means, vow, power, and knowledge.

So what you’re reciting—Generosity, Ethics, Patience, Effort, Concentration, Wisdom, Compassion—is basically a bodhisattva-inspired subset of the paramitas, adapted for practical recitation when physical prostrations aren’t possible. It’s fully aligned with the same intention: cultivating a heart and mind that awakens for the benefit of all beings.

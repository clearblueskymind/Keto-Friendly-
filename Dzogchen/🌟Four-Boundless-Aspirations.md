# Four Boundless Aspirations

1. **May all beings have happiness and the causes of happiness.**

2. **May all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.**

3. **May all beings never be separate from the unconditional happiness that is free from suffering.**

4. **May all beings live in great equanimity, free from attachment and aversion.**

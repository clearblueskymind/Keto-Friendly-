## A traditional Buddhist teaching often used as a contemplative introduction in Dzogchen and other Vajrayana contexts. The “eight freedoms” (sometimes phrased as the “eight freedoms and ten richnesses”) highlight the preciousness and rarity of a human birth, helping practitioners cultivate appreciation, urgency, and clarity in their spiritual practice. They serve as a reminder that life is fleeting and that our circumstances are uniquely favorable for awakening.

The “eight freedoms” usually include reflections like:

1. Not born in hell – You haven’t been reborn in one of the realms of intense suffering.


2. Not born as a hungry ghost (preta) – You aren’t trapped in insatiable craving and deprivation.


3. Not born as an animal – You have human intelligence and the capacity for moral choice.


4. Not born as a demigod or asura – You are not caught in extreme jealousy, competition, or intoxication of power.


5. Born as a human – You have the unique human faculties for study, reflection, and practice.


6. Born in a place where the Dharma is taught – You have access to teachings and spiritual guidance.


7. Born at a time when the teachings exist – The precious Dharma is present and available in this era.


8. Born with faculties that allow practice – You possess a body and mind capable of spiritual cultivation.



Reflecting on these freedoms is meant to create a sense of gratitude and urgency: this rare human birth is like a precious jewel, a chance to recognize the nature of mind and engage deeply with the path. In Dzogchen, this can naturally lead into contemplation of rigpa—the innate, luminous awareness that is our true nature. Orgyen Choling teachers like Orgyen Wangmo or others often start with this because it gently grounds students in the precious opportunity they have, without pushing into fear or guilt.

## Absolutely—after the “eight freedoms,” many Vajrayana and Dzogchen teachers introduce the ten richnesses (ten favorable conditions), which, like the freedoms, emphasize how rare and precious our human life is. 
These richnesses point to the environmental, social, and internal conditions that make spiritual practice possible and fruitful. They are often listed as follows:

- 1. Wealth – Having enough material resources to sustain the body and mind, without excessive struggle for mere survival.


- 2. Health – A body free from debilitating illness that allows practice and study.


- 3. Freedom from oppression – Being born in a society or circumstance that does not suppress spiritual or moral development.


- 4. Safety from violence – Not being in constant danger from war, predation, or abuse.


- 5. Moral virtue – Possessing at least a basic ethical foundation conducive to spiritual cultivation.


- 6. Good friends and companions – Having supportive people who encourage practice, study, and the cultivation of virtue.


- 7. Access to the Dharma – Being able to hear and study teachings, either in person or through texts.


- 8. Intelligence – Having the capacity for understanding, reflection, and discernment.


- 9. Faith and confidence – An inner disposition that allows one to take teachings to heart and apply them.


- 10. Karmic conditions – The favorable ripening of past actions that bring one into circumstances where the Dharma is accessible and effective.



Together, the eight freedoms and ten richnesses form a contemplative framework: the freedoms tell us what we have escaped and what we are, and the richnesses tell us what makes practice possible. In Dzogchen, this reflection isn’t meant to just elicit gratitude—it prepares the mind to settle naturally into awareness of rigpa, the innate, luminous, empty-clear nature of mind.

## I will now explain how each of these freedoms connects specifically to Dzogchen practice and the recognition of the nature of mind—it’s quite beautiful how the teaching flows from gratitude into direct experience. 

## I will now guide you through how these freedoms and richnesses directly lead into Dzogchen contemplation, showing the bridge from appreciation into direct recognition. It’s really elegant how the mind flows from gratitude into presence. Do you want me to do that next?

Wonderful. Let’s explore how the eight freedoms and ten richnesses gently guide the practitioner into Dzogchen contemplation, where one rests in the natural, luminous awareness called rigpa.

Think of it like this: the freedoms first awaken a sense of rare opportunity. When you reflect, “I was not born in hell, I was not born a hungry ghost or animal, I have a human body capable of practice”, there’s a subtle loosening of complacency. You realize: this moment, this very life, is a precious window. In Dzogchen, that recognition softens the mind, making it more open, less grasping, less identified with ordinary worries and distractions.

Next, the ten richnesses show the fertile conditions that make spiritual awakening possible. Realizing: *“I have health, supportive companions, access to teachings, intelligence, karmic conditions”—*you feel a deep gratitude, not just intellectual, but somatic, that carries your attention into the present. In Dzogchen, this is crucial: rigpa cannot arise in a mind weighed down by constant fear, distraction, or resentment. Gratitude and recognition of conditions naturally stabilize attention, like a calm lake reflecting the sky.

From this poised, open state, the teacher invites the student to notice rigpa, the innate, luminous awareness. It’s not something you create—rather, the mind is allowed to rest, as it is, empty yet aware, clear and present. The freedoms and richnesses do something subtle but profound: they shift the mind from grasping at self-concern and ordinary thoughts into spacious awareness, where the sense of “I” softens, and the natural clarity of mind is more easily recognized.

In practical terms, a Dzogchen teacher might guide you:

Reflect gently on the freedoms and richnesses. Let each one touch your body and heart.

Sense the rarity and preciousness of this moment and this human life. Let that feeling settle the mind.

Rest in the recognition: whatever arises, awareness itself is already pure, open, and luminous—rigpa.


The beauty is that gratitude and recognition of these conditions aren’t separate from practice; they become the doorway. The mind naturally opens, and the distinctions between “freedom,” “richness,” and awareness blur.

## A short contemplative practice that uses the eight freedoms and ten richnesses as a direct bridge into resting in rigpa. It’s quite gentle and very suited to someone with a reflective, calm approach. Do you want me to lay that out?

Here’s a gentle, contemplative practice that uses the eight freedoms and ten richnesses as a bridge into Dzogchen awareness. You can do this sitting quietly, or even lying down if that’s more comfortable, moving at a pace that suits your body and mind.

1. Settle the Body and Mind

Take a few slow breaths. Feel the body resting, supported. Let the muscles soften, the mind soften. Notice the rhythm of your breath without trying to control it.

2. Reflect on the Eight Freedoms

One by one, gently recall each freedom:

“I was not born in hell… not as a hungry ghost… not as an animal… I am human… I am born in a place and time where the Dharma exists… I have faculties that allow practice.”


As you name each, feel it in your body. Let a sense of relief, gratitude, and preciousness arise. Don’t rush; pause with each reflection. You might notice a warm openness in the chest or a softening in the mind.

3. Reflect on the Ten Richnesses

Now, consider the ten conditions that make practice possible: health, supportive companions, access to teachings, intelligence, karmic conditions, and so on.

For each richness, allow yourself a moment to fully feel its presence in your life.

You might silently say: “I am fortunate for this… This allows me to rest in awareness.”


Notice that these reflections anchor your mind in gratitude and clarity.

4. Let Gratitude Lead to Awareness

Once you feel grounded in the freedoms and richnesses, simply allow attention to rest in the present moment.

Notice thoughts, sensations, and emotions as they arise, but don’t follow them.

Sense the space in which all phenomena appear—the open, luminous awareness itself.

This is rigpa: clear, awake, and naturally present.


5. Rest Naturally

You don’t have to do anything. There’s nothing to achieve. Let the mind rest as it is, spacious and alert, just aware of itself. If distractions arise, gently return to the sense of presence and openness.

6. Dedicate the Practice

Before concluding, you might offer a silent dedication:
“May this awareness benefit all beings. May all find freedom from suffering and the conditions for awakening.”

The key here is subtle: the freedoms and richnesses are not just thoughts—they are like softening the ground for awareness to emerge naturally. Your mind moves from gratitude to presence, from reflection to recognition, and from rare opportunity to spacious awareness.

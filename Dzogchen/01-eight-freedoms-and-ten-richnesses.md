Introduction: The Eight Freedoms

A traditional Buddhist teaching often used as a contemplative introduction in Dzogchen and other Vajrayana contexts is the “eight freedoms” (sometimes presented alongside the ten richnesses). These highlight the preciousness and rarity of a human birth, helping practitioners cultivate gratitude, clarity, and urgency in their spiritual practice. They serve as a reminder that life is fleeting and our circumstances uniquely favorable for awakening.

The eight freedoms usually include reflections like:

1. Not born in hell – You haven’t been reborn in one of the realms of intense suffering.


2. Not born as a hungry ghost (preta) – You aren’t trapped in insatiable craving and deprivation.


3. Not born as an animal – You have human intelligence and the capacity for moral choice.


4. Not born as a demigod or asura – You are not caught in extreme jealousy, competition, or intoxication of power.


5. Born as a human – You have the unique faculties for study, reflection, and practice.


6. Born in a place where the Dharma is taught – You have access to teachings and spiritual guidance.


7. Born at a time when the teachings exist – The precious Dharma is present and available in this era.


8. Born with faculties that allow practice – You possess a body and mind capable of spiritual cultivation.



Reflecting on these freedoms fosters gratitude and a sense of rare opportunity. In Dzogchen, this naturally leads into contemplation of rigpa, the innate, luminous awareness that is our true nature.

The Ten Richnesses

Following the eight freedoms, many Dzogchen teachers introduce the ten richnesses (ten favorable conditions), which emphasize the conditions that make spiritual practice possible and fruitful:

1. Wealth – Enough material resources to sustain body and mind.


2. Health – A body free from debilitating illness that allows practice and study.


3. Freedom from oppression – A society or circumstance that does not suppress spiritual or moral development.


4. Safety from violence – Not being in constant danger from war, predation, or abuse.


5. Moral virtue – Possessing an ethical foundation conducive to spiritual cultivation.


6. Good friends and companions – Supportive people who encourage practice and virtue.


7. Access to the Dharma – Being able to hear and study teachings.


8. Intelligence – The capacity for understanding, reflection, and discernment.


9. Faith and confidence – An inner disposition that allows one to take teachings to heart.


10. Karmic conditions – Favorable ripening of past actions that bring one to circumstances where the Dharma is accessible and effective.



Together, the eight freedoms and ten richnesses form a contemplative framework: the freedoms remind us what we have escaped and what we are; the richnesses show what makes practice possible. In Dzogchen, this reflection prepares the mind to settle naturally into awareness of rigpa.

From Gratitude to Dzogchen Awareness

The eight freedoms awaken a sense of rare opportunity, gently loosening the grip of ordinary preoccupations. Realizing: “I have a human body, the capacity for practice, and access to the Dharma” softens the mind, making it more open and receptive.

The ten richnesses reveal the fertile conditions that make awakening possible. Gratitude for health, companions, access to teachings, and karmic support naturally stabilizes attention. In Dzogchen, a mind weighed down by fear or distraction cannot recognize rigpa; gratitude creates the calm, open space in which recognition occurs.

From this open state, attention can rest in rigpa—the innate, luminous awareness that is empty yet aware, clear and present. The freedoms and richnesses are not just thoughts—they soften the ground for awareness to emerge, allowing the sense of “I” to loosen, and the natural clarity of mind to shine.

A Contemplative Practice

This gentle practice uses the eight freedoms and ten richnesses as a bridge into Dzogchen awareness:

1. Settle the Body and Mind

Take a few slow breaths. Feel the body supported, the muscles soften, the mind relax.

2. Reflect on the Eight Freedoms

Gently recall each freedom:
“I was not born in hell… not as a hungry ghost… not as an animal… I am human… I have access to teachings… I have faculties for practice.”
Pause with each reflection. Feel gratitude and relief in the body.

3. Reflect on the Ten Richnesses

Consider each condition that supports practice: health, companions, access to teachings, intelligence, karmic conditions.
Silently acknowledge: “I am fortunate for this… This allows me to rest in awareness.”

4. Let Gratitude Lead to Awareness

Allow attention to rest in the present moment, noticing thoughts, sensations, and emotions without following them.
Sense the open, luminous awareness in which all phenomena appear—rigpa.

5. Rest Naturally

There’s nothing to achieve. Simply rest as the mind is, spacious and alert. If distractions arise, return gently to the sense of openness.

6. Dedicate the Practice

Silently offer: “May this awareness benefit all beings. May all find freedom from suffering and the conditions for awakening.”

The subtlety here is that gratitude and recognition of conditions are themselves the doorway. Through reflection on freedoms and richnesses, the mind naturally moves from appreciation to presence, from rare opportunity to spacious awareness.

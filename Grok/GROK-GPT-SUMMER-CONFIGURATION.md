# Hydration Jar Recipe (Keto-Friendly)

This Hydration Jar recipe is designed for hydration and mild digestive support, optimized for a ketogenic diet using high-quality Further Food products. Consumed twice daily, it provides optimal doses of chia seeds, acacia fiber, and gelatin for digestive health, satiety, blood sugar control, joint/skin support, and hydration. Cinnamon (or cardamom) adds flavor without carbs, aligning with keto goals. Sea salt and lemon are omitted to avoid unnecessary ingredients.

## Recipe (Per Serving)
- **1 tbsp (~12 g) soaked chia seeds** (Further Food, assumed organic, high-quality)
- **1 tbsp (~5 g) acacia fiber** (Further Food, assumed high-purity soluble fiber)
- **7 g gelatin** (Further Food Premium Grass-Fed Gelatin Powder, unflavored, type I & III collagen)
- **¼ tsp ground cinnamon** (Ceylon preferred, ~0.7 g; alternative: ¼ tsp ground cardamom)
- **1 quart (946 mL) water**, stirred well and sipped slowly

**Daily Total (2 servings)**:
- 2 tbsp (~24 g) chia seeds
- 2 tbsp (~10 g) acacia fiber
- 14 g gelatin
- ½ tsp cinnamon (~1.4 g; or ½ tsp cardamom)
- 2 quarts (~1.9 L) water

## Preparation Instructions
1. **Chia Seeds**: Soak 1 tbsp (~12 g) in 1 quart water for 15–30 minutes to form a gel, enhancing hydration and digestibility.
2. **Acacia Fiber**: Stir in 1 tbsp (~5 g); dissolves easily without clumping.
3. **Gelatin**: Dissolve 7 g Further Food Premium Gelatin in ~¼ cup warm water to prevent clumping, then add to the quart of water.
4. **Cinnamon**: Add ¼ tsp ground cinnamon (or cardamom) to warm water with gelatin for even flavor distribution. Stir thoroughly.
5. **Consumption**: Prepare two 1-quart servings daily (e.g., morning and afternoon). Sip slowly to maximize hydration. Refrigerate up to 24 hours, stirring if gelatin thickens.
6. **Tolerability**: Start with one serving/day if new to high fiber, increasing to two over 1–2 weeks to avoid bloating.

## Scientific Benefits
The Hydration Jar, consumed twice daily with Further Food products, delivers keto-friendly benefits, enhanced by cinnamon’s blood sugar support.

### 1. Hydration
- **Components**: 2 quarts (~1.9 L) water provides ~60–95% daily fluid needs (2–3 L, NIH). Chia’s gel-forming (absorbs 10–12x weight) and gelatin’s viscosity enhance water retention.
- **Evidence**: 2016 *Journal of Food Science* notes chia’s hydration potential in athletes.
- **Benefit**: Robust hydration for keto dieters, supporting ketosis and electrolyte balance.

### 2. Digestive Health
- **Components**: ~20 g fiber/day (10 g chia, 10 g acacia) promotes bowel regularity and prebiotic effects. Gelatin’s amino acids may support gut lining.
- **Evidence**:
  - **Chia**: 25 g/day improves stool consistency (2015 *Journal of Food Science and Technology*).
  - **Acacia**: 10 g/day increases Bifidobacteria, reduces IBS symptoms (2012 *British Journal of Nutrition*, 2018 *Journal of Functional Foods*).
  - **Gelatin**: May reduce leaky gut (2017 *Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology*, limited data).
- **Benefit**: Supports bowel regularity and gut microbiome, countering keto’s low-fiber risk.

### 3. Satiety and Blood Sugar Control
- **Components**: ~20 g fiber (chia + acacia) slows glucose absorption; ~18 g protein (chia + gelatin) enhances fullness. Cinnamon (1.4 g/day) improves insulin sensitivity.
- **Evidence**:
  - **Chia**: 15–25 g/day reduces appetite (2014 *Nutrición Hospitalaria*).
  - **Acacia**: 10 g/day improves glycemic control (2016 *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*).
  - **Gelatin**: 10–20 g/day boosts satiety (2015 *European Journal of Clinical Nutrition*).
  - **Cinnamon**: 1–6 g/day reduces glucose spikes (2007 *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*).
- **Benefit**: Promotes fullness, supports ketosis by stabilizing blood sugar.

### 4. Joint and Skin Health
- **Components**: Gelatin (14 g/day) provides collagen-derived amino acids. Chia adds calcium (~120 mg), magnesium (~80 mg).
- **Evidence**:
  - **Gelatin**: 5–15 g/day reduces joint pain (2008 *Therapeutic Advances in Musculoskeletal Disease*). 2.5–10 g/day enhances skin elasticity (2019 *Journal of Drugs in Dermatology*).
  - **Chia**: Micronutrients support connective tissue.
- **Benefit**: Modest support for joint comfort and skin hydration (8+ weeks).

### 5. Heart Health
- **Components**: Chia’s ~5 g ALA and ~10 g fiber, acacia’s ~10 g fiber support cholesterol reduction. Cinnamon’s antioxidants may reduce cardiovascular risk.
- **Evidence**:
  - **Chia**: 25 g/day lowers LDL (2015 *Journal of the American College of Nutrition*).
  - **Acacia**: 10 g/day improves HDL/LDL ratios (2017 *Lipids in Health and Disease*).
  - **Cinnamon**: Polyphenols support heart health (2015 *Nutrition Reviews*).
- **Benefit**: Modest cholesterol and cardiovascular support, keto-compatible.

### Further Food Advantage
- **Gelatin**: Further Food Premium Grass-Fed Gelatin Powder is high-quality, third-party tested, non-GMO, pasture-raised bovine, ensuring purity for joint, gut, and skin benefits.
- **Chia/Acacia**: Assumed high-quality (organic, pure) based on brand ethos.
- **Sourcing**: Gelatin available at FurtherFood.com, Amazon, Walmart (~$49.99/31.74 oz, ~90 servings at 10 g). Verify chia/acacia sources.

## Practical Considerations
- **Flavor**: Cinnamon (¼ tsp/serving, ~1.4 g/day) adds warm, sweet-spicy flavor, keto-friendly, and blood sugar benefits. Cardamom (¼ tsp/serving) offers aromatic, citrusy taste. Start with ¼ tsp, increase to ½ tsp for bolder flavor.
- **Tolerability**: ~20 g fiber/day is safe but start with one serving if new to high fiber to avoid bloating. Gelatin (14 g/day) is well-tolerated; >20 g may cause digestive upset.
- **Storage**: Prepare fresh or refrigerate up to 24 hours. Stir if gelatin thickens.
- **Allergies**: Rare for chia, acacia, gelatin, cinnamon; avoid if sensitive to bovine gelatin.

## Potential Side Effects
- **Digestive**: Bloating from ~20 g fiber if introduced quickly. Start gradually.
- **Gelatin**: Low risk with Further Food’s purity; avoid if allergic to bovine sources.
- **Cinnamon**: Ceylon preferred; cassia’s coumarin may affect liver at high doses (>1 tsp/day).

## Conclusion
The keto-friendly Hydration Jar, consumed twice daily with Further Food products, delivers hydration, digestive health, satiety, blood sugar control, and joint/skin/heart benefits. Cinnamon (½ tsp/day) ensures great taste and keto-compatible blood sugar support. The recipe is effective, safe, and streamlined with Further Food’s high-quality ingredients.

# Hydration Jar Recipe

This Hydration Jar recipe is designed for hydration and mild digestive support, using high-quality ingredients from Further Food. The recipe is consumed twice daily, providing optimal doses of chia seeds, acacia fiber, and gelatin for digestive health, satiety, blood sugar control, joint/skin support, and hydration. Bentonite clay is omitted to avoid minimal benefits and potential risks.

## Recipe (Per Serving)
- **1 tbsp (~12 g) soaked chia seeds** (Further Food, assumed organic, high-quality)
- **1 tbsp (~5 g) acacia fiber** (Further Food, assumed high-purity soluble fiber)
- **7 g gelatin** (Further Food Premium Grass-Fed Gelatin Powder, unflavored, type I & III collagen)
- **Juice & pulp of 1 small lemon** (~2 tbsp juice, ~10–15 mg vitamin C)
- **¼ tsp sea salt** (~575 mg sodium)
- **1 quart (946 mL) water**, stirred well and sipped slowly

**Daily Total (2 servings)**:
- 2 tbsp (~24 g) chia seeds
- 2 tbsp (~10 g) acacia fiber
- 14 g gelatin
- Juice & pulp of 2 small lemons
- ½ tsp sea salt
- 2 quarts (~1.9 L) water

## Preparation Instructions
1. **Chia Seeds**: Soak 1 tbsp (~12 g) in 1 quart water for 15–30 minutes to form a gel, enhancing hydration and digestibility.
2. **Acacia Fiber**: Stir in 1 tbsp (~5 g); dissolves easily without clumping.
3. **Gelatin**: Dissolve 7 g Further Food Premium Gelatin in ~¼ cup warm water to prevent clumping, then add to the quart of water.
4. **Lemon & Salt**: Add juice/pulp of 1 small lemon and ¼ tsp sea salt. Stir thoroughly.
5. **Consumption**: Prepare two 1-quart servings daily (e.g., morning and afternoon). Sip slowly to maximize hydration. Refrigerate up to 24 hours, stirring if gelatin thickens.
6. **Tolerability**: Start with one serving/day if new to high fiber, increasing to two over 1–2 weeks to avoid bloating.

## Scientific Benefits
The Hydration Jar, consumed twice daily with Further Food products, delivers evidence-based benefits, optimized by high-quality ingredients.

### 1. Hydration
- **Components**: 2 quarts (~1.9 L) water provides ~60–95% of daily fluid needs (2–3 L, NIH). Chia’s gel-forming (absorbs 10–12x weight) and gelatin’s viscosity enhance water retention. Sodium (~1150 mg/day) supports electrolyte balance, mimicking mild rehydration solutions.
- **Evidence**: 2016 *Journal of Food Science* review notes chia’s hydration potential in athletes; sodium aids fluid retention (WHO rehydration guidelines).
- **Benefit**: Robust hydration for daily needs or active lifestyles, enhanced by chia, gelatin, and salt.

### 2. Digestive Health
- **Components**: ~20 g fiber/day (10 g chia, 10 g acacia) promotes bowel regularity, prebiotic effects, and microbiota diversity. Gelatin’s amino acids (glycine, proline) may support gut lining.
- **Evidence**:
  - **Chia**: 25 g/day improves stool consistency (2015 *Journal of Food Science and Technology*).
  - **Acacia**: 10 g/day increases Bifidobacteria, reduces IBS symptoms (2012 *British Journal of Nutrition*, 2018 *Journal of Functional Foods*).
  - **Gelatin**: May reduce leaky gut (2017 *Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology*, limited human data).
- **Benefit**: Supports regular bowel movements, gut microbiome health, and mild gut lining repair. Covers ~50–80% daily fiber needs.

### 3. Satiety and Blood Sugar Control
- **Components**: ~20 g fiber (chia + acacia) slows glucose absorption; ~18 g protein (chia + gelatin) enhances fullness.
- **Evidence**:
  - **Chia**: 15–25 g/day reduces appetite, stabilizes blood sugar (2014 *Nutrición Hospitalaria*, 2016 *European Journal of Clinical Nutrition*).
  - **Acacia**: 10 g/day improves glycemic control (2016 *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*).
  - **Gelatin**: 10–20 g/day boosts satiety (2015 *European Journal of Clinical Nutrition*).
- **Benefit**: Promotes fullness, aids weight management, and stabilizes blood sugar, ideal for metabolic health.

### 4. Joint and Skin Health
- **Components**: Gelatin (14 g/day) provides collagen-derived amino acids (glycine, proline). Chia adds calcium (~120 mg), magnesium (~80 mg).
- **Evidence**:
  - **Gelatin**: 5–15 g/day reduces joint pain, improves flexibility (2008 *Therapeutic Advances in Musculoskeletal Disease*, 2015 *Nutrition Journal*). 2.5–10 g/day enhances skin elasticity (2019 *Journal of Drugs in Dermatology*).
  - **Chia**: Micronutrients support connective tissue (anecdotal synergy).
- **Benefit**: Modest support for joint comfort and skin hydration/elasticity with consistent use (8+ weeks).

### 5. Heart Health
- **Components**: Chia’s ~5 g ALA and ~10 g fiber, plus acacia’s ~10 g fiber, support cholesterol reduction.
- **Evidence**: 25 g/day chia lowers LDL (2015 *Journal of the American College of Nutrition*). 10 g/day acacia improves HDL/LDL ratios (2017 *Lipids in Health and Disease*).
- **Benefit**: Modest cholesterol and cardiovascular support, enhanced by fiber.

### Further Food Advantage
- **Gelatin**: Further Food Premium Grass-Fed Gelatin Powder is high-quality, third-party tested, non-GMO, and sourced from pasture-raised bovine, ensuring purity and efficacy for joint, gut, and skin benefits.
- **Chia/Acacia**: Assumed high-quality (organic, pure) based on Further Food’s commitment to clean ingredients, aligning with research standards.
- **Sourcing**: Gelatin available at FurtherFood.com, Amazon, Walmart (~$49.99 for 31.74 oz, ~90 servings at 10 g). Ensure chia/acacia are from reputable sources if not Further Food.

## Practical Considerations
- **Tolerability**: ~20 g fiber/day is safe but start with one serving if new to high fiber, increasing over 1–2 weeks to avoid bloating. Gelatin (14 g/day) is well-tolerated; >20 g may cause digestive upset. Sodium (~1150 mg) is safe for most; reduce to 1/8 tsp/serving if sodium-sensitive (e.g., hypertension).
- **Storage**: Prepare fresh or refrigerate up to 24 hours. Stir if gelatin thickens.
- **Allergies**: Rare for chia, acacia, gelatin; avoid if sensitive to bovine gelatin or related ingredients.
- **Quality**: Further Food’s third-party testing ensures gelatin purity. Verify chia/acacia sources for similar quality.

## Potential Side Effects
- **Digestive**: Bloating/gas from rapid fiber increase (mitigate with gradual introduction).
- **Sodium**: Monitor if sodium-sensitive; consult doctor for hypertension/kidney issues.
- **Gelatin**: Low risk with Further Food’s purity; avoid if allergic to bovine sources.

## Conclusion
The Hydration Jar, consumed twice daily with Further Food products, delivers optimal hydration, digestive health, satiety, blood sugar control, and modest joint/skin/heart benefits. The combination of 24 g chia seeds, 10 g acacia fiber, and 14 g gelatin, plus lemon and salt in 2 quarts water, is scientifically supported and practical. Further Food’s high-quality gelatin enhances efficacy, and omitting bentonite clay avoids unnecessary risks. Sip slowly, monitor tolerance, and enjoy as a daily wellness drink.

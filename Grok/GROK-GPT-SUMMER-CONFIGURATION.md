## Primary Daily Hydration Drink

# Hydration Jar Recipe (Keto-Friendly with Pumpkin Seed Powder)

This Hydration Jar recipe is designed for hydration, mild digestive support, and ketogenic diet compatibility, using high-quality Further Food and Stony Brook WholeHeartedFoods products. Consumed twice daily, it provides optimal doses of chia seeds, acacia fiber, gelatin, and pumpkin seed powder for digestive health, satiety, blood sugar control, joint/skin support, heart health, and electrolyte balance. Cinnamon adds flavor without carbs, and Stony Brook’s US-grown pumpkin seed powder enhances taste and nutrients.

## Recipe (Per Serving)
- **1 tbsp (~12 g) soaked chia seeds** (Further Food, assumed organic, high-quality)
- **1 tbsp (~5 g) acacia fiber** (Further Food, assumed high-purity soluble fiber)
- **7 g gelatin** (Further Food Premium Grass-Fed Gelatin Powder, unflavored, type I & III collagen)
- **¼ cup (~30 g) pumpkin seed powder** (Stony Brook WholeHeartedFoods, organic, US-grown)
- **¼ tsp ground cinnamon** (Ceylon preferred, ~0.7 g; alternative: ¼ tsp ground cardamom)
- **1 quart (946 mL) water**, stirred well and sipped slowly

**Daily Total (2 servings)**:
- 2 tbsp (~24 g) chia seeds
- 2 tbsp (~10 g) acacia fiber
- 14 g gelatin
- ½ cup (~60 g) pumpkin seed powder
- ½ tsp cinnamon (~1.4 g; or ½ tsp cardamom)
- 2 quarts (~1.9 L) water

## Preparation Instructions
1. **Chia Seeds**: Soak 1 tbsp (~12 g) in 1 quart water for 15–30 minutes to form a gel, enhancing hydration and digestibility.
2. **Acacia Fiber**: Stir in 1 tbsp (~5 g); dissolves easily without clumping.
3. **Gelatin**: Dissolve 7 g Further Food Premium Gelatin in ~¼ cup warm water to prevent clumping, then add to the quart of water.
4. **Pumpkin Seed Powder**: Blend or stir ¼ cup (~30 g) Stony Brook pumpkin seed powder thoroughly to avoid grittiness, ensuring even distribution.
5. **Cinnamon**: Add ¼ tsp ground cinnamon (or cardamom) to warm water with gelatin for flavor dispersion. Stir well.
6. **Consumption**: Prepare two 1-quart servings daily (e.g., morning and afternoon). Sip slowly to maximize hydration. Refrigerate up to 24 hours, stirring if gelatin thickens.
7. **Tolerability**: Start with one serving/day if new to high fiber, increasing to two over 1–2 weeks to avoid bloating.

## Scientific Benefits
The Hydration Jar, consumed twice daily with Further Food and Stony Brook products, delivers keto-friendly benefits, enhanced by pumpkin seed powder and cinnamon.

### 1. Hydration
- **Components**: 2 quarts (~1.9 L) water provides ~60–95% daily fluid needs (2–3 L, NIH). Chia’s gel-forming (absorbs 10–12x weight) and gelatin’s viscosity enhance water retention.
- **Evidence**: 2016 *Journal of Food Science* notes chia’s hydration potential in athletes.
- **Benefit**: Robust hydration, supporting ketosis and electrolyte balance, critical for keto (as you’ve explored with electrolyte drinks).

### 2. Digestive Health
- **Components**: ~16 g fiber/day (10 g chia, 6 g acacia) promotes bowel regularity and prebiotic effects. Gelatin’s amino acids may support gut lining. Pumpkin seed powder adds ~6 g fiber.
- **Evidence**:
  - **Chia**: 25 g/day improves stool consistency (2015 *Journal of Food Science and Technology*).
  - **Acacia**: 10 g/day increases Bifidobacteria, reduces IBS symptoms (2012 *British Journal of Nutrition*, 2018 *Journal of Functional Foods*).
  - **Gelatin**: May reduce leaky gut (2017 *Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology*, limited data).
  - **Pumpkin Seed Powder**: ~3 g fiber/¼ cup aids digestion (USDA data).
- **Benefit**: Counters keto’s low-fiber risk, supports gut microbiome and regularity.

### 3. Satiety and Blood Sugar Control
- **Components**: ~16 g fiber (chia + acacia), ~38 g protein (chia + gelatin + pumpkin), and cinnamon (1.4 g/day) enhance fullness and insulin sensitivity.
- **Evidence**:
  - **Chia**: 15–25 g/day reduces appetite (2014 *Nutrición Hospitalaria*).
  - **Acacia**: 10 g/day improves glycemic control (2016 *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*).
  - **Gelatin**: 10–20 g/day boosts satiety (2015 *European Journal of Clinical Nutrition*).
  - **Cinnamon**: 1–6 g/day reduces glucose spikes (2007 *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*).
  - **Pumpkin Seed Powder**: Protein/fat enhances satiety (2018 *Nutrients*).
- **Benefit**: Promotes fullness, stabilizes blood sugar, supports ketosis (aligns with your <50 g carb buffer).

### 4. Joint and Skin Health
- **Components**: Gelatin (14 g/day) provides collagen-derived amino acids. Chia and pumpkin seed powder add calcium (~120 mg), magnesium (~420 mg).
- **Evidence**:
  - **Gelatin**: 5–15 g/day reduces joint pain (2008 *Therapeutic Advances in Musculoskeletal Disease*). 2.5–10 g/day enhances skin elasticity (2019 *Journal of Drugs in Dermatology*).
  - **Chia/Pumpkin**: Micronutrients support connective tissue.
- **Benefit**: Modest support for joint comfort and skin hydration (8+ weeks).

### 5. Heart Health
- **Components**: Chia’s ~5 g ALA, ~10 g fiber, acacia’s ~6 g fiber, and pumpkin’s ~3 g ALA support cholesterol reduction. Cinnamon’s antioxidants aid cardiovascular health.
- **Evidence**:
  - **Chia**: 25 g/day lowers LDL (2015 *Journal of the American College of Nutrition*).
  - **Acacia**: 10 g/day improves HDL/LDL ratios (2017 *Lipids in Health and Disease*).
  - **Pumpkin Seed Powder**: Omega-3s/magnesium support heart health (2018 *Nutrients*).
  - **Cinnamon**: Polyphenols reduce cardiovascular risk (2015 *Nutrition Reviews*).
- **Benefit**: Modest cholesterol and heart health support, keto-compatible.

### 6. Electrolyte Balance
- **Components**: Pumpkin seed powder (~480 mg potassium, ~420 mg magnesium/day) supports electrolyte needs.
- **Evidence**: Potassium/magnesium aid muscle function and hydration (2019 *Journal of the American College of Nutrition*).
- **Benefit**: Complements keto’s electrolyte demands (as you’ve explored with potassium supplements).

### Further Food and Stony Brook Advantage
- **Gelatin**: Further Food Premium Grass-Fed Gelatin Powder is high-quality, third-party tested, non-GMO, pasture-raised bovine, ensuring purity for joint, gut, and skin benefits.
- **Chia/Acacia**: Assumed high-quality (organic, pure) based on Further Food’s ethos.
- **Pumpkin Seed Powder**: Stony Brook WholeHeartedFoods is organic, US-grown, aligning with your preference for non-China-sourced seeds.
- **Sourcing**: Gelatin (~$49.99/31.74 oz, ~90 servings at 10 g) and pumpkin seed powder available at FurtherFood.com, Amazon, Walmart, or StonyBrookWholeHeartedFoods.com.

## Practical Considerations
- **Flavor**: Cinnamon (¼ tsp/serving, ~1.4 g/day) adds warm, sweet-spicy flavor, pairing well with pumpkin seed powder’s nutty taste. Cardamom (¼ tsp/serving) offers aromatic, citrusy notes. Start with ¼ tsp, increase to ½ tsp for bolder flavor.
- **Texture**: Blend pumpkin seed powder to avoid grittiness; chia/gelatin maintain gel-like consistency.
- **Tolerability**: ~16 g fiber/day is safe but start with one serving if new to high fiber to avoid bloating. Gelatin (14 g/day) and pumpkin seed powder (60 g/day) are well-tolerated.
- **Storage**: Prepare fresh or refrigerate up to 24 hours. Stir if gelatin thickens.
- **Allergies**: Rare for chia, acacia, gelatin, cinnamon, pumpkin; avoid if sensitive to bovine gelatin or seeds.
- **Keto Fit**: ~2.2 g net carbs/day keeps recipe well within your <50 g carb buffer.

## Potential Side Effects
- **Digestive**: Bloating from ~16 g fiber or pumpkin seed powder if introduced quickly. Start gradually.
- **Gelatin**: Low risk with Further Food’s purity; avoid if allergic to bovine sources.
- **Cinnamon**: Ceylon preferred; cassia’s coumarin may affect liver at high doses (>1 tsp/day).
- **Calories**: ~452 kcal/day from drink; monitor total intake if weight loss is a goal.

## Conclusion
The keto-friendly Hydration Jar with Stony Brook pumpkin seed powder, consumed twice daily, delivers hydration, digestive health, satiety, blood sugar control, joint/skin/heart health, and electrolyte support. Cinnamon ensures great taste, and pumpkin seed powder adds nutty flavor and nutrients, aligning with your keto diet and preference for US-grown ingredients.

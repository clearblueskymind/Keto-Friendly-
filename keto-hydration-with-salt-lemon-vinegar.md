# 💧 Keto Hydration with Sea Salt, Lemon & Vinegar  
*How to optimize hydration, digestion, and electrolyte balance while fat-burning*

---

## 🧂 Why Hydration is Critical on Keto

When you reduce carbs, your body flushes excess water and sodium — this is natural, but it can lead to:

- Fatigue  
- Lightheadedness  
- Muscle cramps  
- Brain fog  
- Constipation  

Replacing fluids **and** electrolytes daily is essential.

## ⚖️ Sea Salt vs. Lemon Juice vs. Vinegar

Each one has a **unique role** — they are complementary, not interchangeable.

### 🧂 **Sea Salt** (or Trace Mineral Drops)

- Replaces sodium lost through urination  
- Prevents fatigue, headaches, and dizziness  
- Supports nerve and muscle function  
- Keeps hydration levels stable  

✅ **Dosage:** ¼ tsp per quart of water  
✅ Use high-quality sea salt or Himalayan pink salt  

---

### 🍋 **Lemon Juice**

- Enhances liver detox pathways  
- Supports bile production (critical for fat digestion)  
- Adds potassium and vitamin C  
- Can help prevent kidney stones on keto  

✅ **Dosage:** 1–2 tsp per glass or quart  
✅ Fresh-squeezed is best  

---

### 🍎 **Apple Cider Vinegar**

- Balances stomach acid (especially useful with heavy protein meals)  
- Supports blood sugar regulation  
- Enhances mineral absorption  
- Anti-inflammatory & antimicrobial benefits  

✅ **Dosage:** 1 tsp to 1 tbsp per glass or quart  
✅ Use raw, unfiltered vinegar with the “mother”

🛏️ Red+ Recovery Routine

A sanctuary flow for very-low-energy mornings and flare states.


---

🔁 Trigger Prompts

This flow is returned anytime you ask:

“How does my morning look?”

“What should I do this morning?”

“What's my plan this morning?”

“Guide me through my Red+ morning”


✅ From now on, here’s how I’ll integrate it:

When you say:

> “What’s my plan today?”
“How should I start the day?”
“What should I do now?”
“What are my options?”



I will gently ask:

> “First, how’s your energy? Red+, Red, Yellow, or Green?”

🔴 Red+ Zone (Very low energy + flare management)

🌙 Prioritize absolute rest and quiet

🛏️ Stay horizontal as much as possible

💧 Small sips of water with electrolytes (not quart-sized)

🍵 Broth or very soft, pre-prepped food only if hungry

🚫 Skip all non-essential movement

💨 Optional: 2–3 deep slow breaths, nothing forced

🧘 Internal language: “This is repair mode. The less I do, the more I heal.”

☀️ Morning Plan (Red+)

1. Rest First

Stay in bed or in your most comfortable resting position.

Use pillows, blanket, or props to fully relax.



---

2. Gentle Hydration

Small sips of water with a pinch of salt or electrolyte drops.

Stop if it feels heavy.



---

3. Optional Micro-Movement

Only if it feels soothing (not required):

Wiggle toes or fingers for 10–20 seconds

One gentle shoulder roll or jaw release

Otherwise, stay still.




---

4. Quiet Self-Check (very light)

Ask yourself softly:

“What’s the kindest thing I can do for myself right now?”

No need to answer with words — let the question itself be enough.



---

5. Nourishment Preview

If later you need food: consider soft, ready-to-go options (broth, yogurt, avocado).

No prep required now.



---

🧭 Summary Flow (Red+)

🛏️ Rest, not action

💧 Sip small amounts of salted/mineral water

💤 Movement optional, minimal

🧘 Gentle self-check, no pressure

🍵 Only soft, easy foods if hungry



---

💬 Daily Reminder

> “Doing less is doing more. Your body is already working deeply to heal.
In Red+, stillness is your medicine.”

Would you like me to also create a matching “Red” (not plus) file so you have a tiered system:

🔴 Red+ = flare / collapse mode

🔴 Red = very low energy but slightly more capacity

🟡 Yellow = active recovery

🟢 Green = stable, energized


That way you’ll have a full 4-color map you can call up anytime.

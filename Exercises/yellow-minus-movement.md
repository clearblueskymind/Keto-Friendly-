# 💛 Yellow-Minus Movement Guide  
_Supportive, keto-aligned movement options for low-energy days._

---

## 🌤️ Purpose  
On “Yellow-Minus” days, energy is limited — but stillness can amplify fatigue, brain fog, and emotional stagnation. These gentle, deliberate movements support:

- Circulation  
- Digestion  
- Lymphatic drainage  
- Nervous system regulation  
- Mood and cognitive clarity

## ✅ Minimum Movement Checklist (Do What You Can)

### 1. 🧘 Kapalabhati Breathing (1 round)  
- Sit in a chair  
- Exhale forcefully through the nose (short bursts)  
- Passive inhale  
- ~30–40 repetitions = 1 round  
> *Clears fog, stimulates core, activates parasympathetic reset*

---

### 2. ⚖️ Weight Shifting  
- Stand with feet shoulder-width  
- Gently shift weight from left foot to right foot  
- Slow, rhythmic sway for 1–2 minutes  
> *Stimulates leg circulation and vestibular balance without overexertion*

---

### 3. 🚶‍♂️ Gentle Walking in Place  
- Barefoot if possible  
- March lightly in place for 1–3 minutes  
- Arms loose or lightly swinging  
> *Promotes lymph movement and lowers postural tension*

---

### 4. 🚿 Take a Shower  
- Warm (or contrast) shower to stimulate skin and nerve endings  
- Optional: dry-brush beforehand for extra circulation  
> *Mentally refreshing and physically stabilizing*

---

## 🔁 Optional Flow  
If energy permits:

```
[ ] Kapalabhati

## 🧠 Mindset  
This isn’t about burning calories — it’s about honoring your body’s needs.  
A few minutes of low-intensity movement can shift your day *without draining your reserves*.

# 🧪 Daily Ketone & Waist Tracking Protocol  
*A standardized method for tracking Richard’s metabolic state and fat-loss progress.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To monitor fat-burning and visceral fat reduction using consistent, daily markers.

This protocol ensures **accurate comparison over time** by taking measurements under the same conditions each day.

---

## ⏰ Measurement Time

**Every morning at 7:00 AM**

---

## 📏 Measurements to Record

### 1. **Ketone Level**
- Use blood ketone meter or test strip  
- Record as: `mmol/L` (e.g., 0.7 mmol/L)  
- Ideal fat-burning zone: **0.5 – 1.5 mmol/L**

### 2. **Waist Circumference**
- Measure across the **navel (belly button)**  
- Use a soft measuring tape  
- Record as inches (e.g., 48.5 inches)  
- Goal: Gradual reduction over time (target milestone: 39 inches)

## ✅ How to Log

- Only measurements taken **at 7:00 AM** are considered **official daily entries**
- Other readings can be logged, but will be marked as **non-standardized**

## 📊 How It’s Used

- Included in your daily stat report when you ask:  
  > “What are my stats today?”

- Tracked weekly in summary logs (e.g., waist & ketone averages)
- Used to identify:
  - Plateaus

Yesâ€¦ exactly like that. ðŸŒ¿

In Dzogchen, Rigpa doesnâ€™t disappear when the mind or body is uncomfortableâ€”it doesnâ€™t get pushed around by sounds, pain, or fatigue. Even screaming, persistent tinnitus can become a doorway rather than a barrier.

The practice is simple but subtle:

1. Notice the sound fullyâ€”its pitch, its intensity, its movementâ€”without judgment or resistance. Let it be loud. Let it be there. Donâ€™t try to fix it or make it go away.


2. Turn your attention toward the knower, the one who hears it. You might silently ask:
âœ¨ What is it that is aware of this sound?


3. Rest in the awareness itself, not the sound. The tinnitus may roar, but awareness is the sky in which it arises. Awareness is not affectedâ€”it is the ground, vast and unshakable.


4. Softly soften your body and mindâ€”even for a few secondsâ€”letting tension around the sound dissolve into the openness of knowing itself.



A small haiku for this moment:


---

Screaming in the ear,
yet the sky of knowing remainsâ€”
sound drifts into peace.

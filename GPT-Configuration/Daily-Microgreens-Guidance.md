GPT “configuration file” for myself (GPT)—a kind of internal guide so that whenever user mentions a new day, I know exactly how to track your microgreen trays and give you gentle, appropriate instructions. I’ll structure it so it covers both trays, the stages of growth, and daily guidance.

## Microgreen Sprouting Project – Configuration File

## Project Name: Paper-Towel Microgreens (Broccoli & Mixed Tray)
FIRST Start Date: September 1, 2025
Trays:

1. Broccoli-only tray


2. Mixed tray (broccoli, purple kohlrabi, radish, collard, turnip)



## Growth Stages:

1. Day 0–2 – Germination

Seeds swelling under damp towel

Roots begin forming

Keep tray in warm, dim location

Mist lightly twice a day

Observation: Seeds may swell, tiny white roots may peek



2. Day 3–4 – Sprouts Emerging / Top Towel Removal

Remove top towel gently when most shoots are pushing upward

Move tray to bright, indirect light

Mist once or twice a day to keep bottom towel damp

Observation: White shoots appear; cotyledons begin to unfold



3. Day 5–7 – Cotyledons Unfolding / Chlorophyll Formation

Leaves open; starts greening

Observation: Cotyledons visible; broccoli and radish green quickly, kohlrabi, collard, and turnip slower

Mist lightly, monitor moisture

Begin thinking about early harvest if desired (cotyledons only)



4. Day 8–10 – True Leaves Appearing / Optional Extended Growth

Observation: True leaves forming; stems thickening; colors deepen

Harvest timing: Either eat whole (roots + leaves) or snip desired amount

Mist lightly and continue light exposure



5. Continuous / Rotational Harvesting

Partial harvest leaves remaining sprouts to grow further

Replace top layer of paper towel if needed for hygiene

Sow new seeds in rotation for staggered harvest




## Daily Instructions Logic:

Each new day you mention triggers:

1. Reminder of stage for each tray


2. Actions to do today (mist, remove towel, move to light, partial harvest)


3. Observations to watch for (color, growth, roots, mold)


4. Tips & gentle encouragement (meditative, low-stress, mindful)




## Special Notes:

Paper towel method: keep damp, not soggy

Eat whole: roots + cotyledons + leaves, especially for soil-free trays

Mixed tray: staggered growth is normal; radish and broccoli fastest, collard and kohlrabi slower

Microgreen flavor guidance:

Broccoli: mild, tender

Purple kohlrabi: sweet, mild earthy, purple stems

Radish: crisp, slightly peppery

Collard: mildly bitter, cabbage-like

Turnip: sweet, earthy




---

## With this configuration, every time you mention it’s a new day, I will:

Identify current stage for each tray

Give actions to take today

Suggest observations and meditative noticing

Offer gentle tips or reminders about taste, harvest, or handling

## ADDITIONAL NOTES:

## Here’s a gentle, meditative day-by-day guide for your broccoli microgreens on a paper towel. It’s designed to help you tend them without stress, keeping them clean, hydrated, and gradually turning green.

Broccoli Microgreens: Week-Long Rhythm

Day 0 – Sowing

Seeds are spread on a damp paper towel and lightly covered with another damp towel.

Keep in a warm, dim spot.

Mist lightly twice a day.


Day 1–2 – Germination

Seeds begin to swell; roots may start to peek.

Keep the top towel in place to maintain humidity.

Continue gentle misting.


Day 3 – Sprouts Emerging

Tiny white shoots begin pushing upward, reaching the top towel.

Remove the top towel gently. This is their first taste of air and light.

Move tray to bright indirect light.

Mist lightly once or twice daily, keeping the bottom towel damp.


Day 4–5 – Cotyledons Unfolding

Rounded first leaves (cotyledons) appear.

Sprouts begin to green as chlorophyll forms.

Continue light misting. If bottom paper towel starts drying, add a few drops of water to keep it moist.

Watch for any signs of mold; remove affected sprouts if necessary.


Day 6–7 – True Leaves Beginning

Small “true leaves” start to form, resembling miniature broccoli leaves.

Continue misting lightly.

By the end of day 7, many microgreens are ready to harvest if you like tender cotyledons.

If you prefer slightly larger microgreens with true leaves, let them grow another 2–3 days.


Day 8–10 – Optional Extended Growth

Microgreens deepen in green color and flavor.

Keep misting and providing light.

Harvest when the first true leaves are fully visible but before the shoots become tough.


Harvesting

You can eat them whole, roots and all, or snip just above the paper towel if you prefer.

Wash lightly if desired.



---

This schedule lets the broccoli sprouts gently transition from germination to cotyledons to true leaves, with minimal fuss and maximum meditative enjoyment.

## The other mix that I have is a mix of broccoli, purple kohlrabi, radish, collard, and turnip.

Ah, that mix is a beautiful symphony of tiny plants! Each one brings its own delicate flavor, texture, and subtle color to your microgreen tray—purple kohlrabi giving hints of deep violet, radish with a gentle peppery bite, collard leaves tenderly unfolding, turnip bringing mild sweetness, and broccoli quietly grounding the mix. On a paper towel, this mix will not only be visually striking as the shoots emerge, but each tiny plant will behave slightly differently as it grows.

A few gentle pointers for your mix:

Germination pace: Radish and broccoli usually sprout first, often within 2–3 days. Kohlrabi and turnip may be slightly slower. Collard can be a little slower still. Mist and observe daily, and don’t worry if some seeds lag behind—the slower ones will catch up once the cotyledons begin to open.

Light and color: As the shoots begin to see light, the purple kohlrabi and radish stems will deepen in color. Indirect sunlight is perfect—it encourages the greens and purples to develop without drying the paper towel too quickly.

Roots: Since you’re growing on a paper towel, all roots are edible. Kohlrabi and radish roots will be slightly firmer than broccoli’s tender white ones, but all are mild and enjoyable if eaten whole.

Harvesting: For a visually and nutritionally balanced tray, you can harvest once the first true leaves start to appear, or continue another day or two for slightly larger shoots. Snip only what you need if you want a continuous harvest, leaving the rest to grow.


It’s a lovely meditation just watching these tiny siblings grow together, each showing its own character while forming a little forest of microgreens.

## If you like, I can sketch a mini day-by-day guide for this mixed tray, noting which seeds usually pop first, when to remove the top towel, and when the mix will be ready for your first harvest. It can help you anticipate the rhythm of growth without stress. Do you want me to do that?

Perfect. Here’s a gentle, day-by-day guide for your broccoli–kohlrabi–radish–collard–turnip microgreen mix on a paper towel. It respects the subtle differences in germination and leaf development, while keeping things meditative and low-effort.

Mixed Microgreen Tray: Paper-Towel Timeline

Day 0 – Sowing

Spread the mixed seeds evenly on a damp paper towel in your tray.

Cover with a second damp towel to maintain humidity.

Keep in a warm, dim spot.

Mist gently twice a day.


Day 1–2 – Germination begins

Radish and broccoli usually swell first; tiny white shoots may begin to emerge.

Kohlrabi, turnip, and collard may still be slow, which is normal.

Keep top towel in place; maintain gentle misting.


Day 3 – Sprouts emerging

Radish and broccoli shoots may push against the top towel.

Remove the top towel gently when most visible shoots are emerging.

Move tray to bright indirect light; this is the first gentle sunlight they’ll experience.

Mist lightly once or twice a day to keep the bottom towel damp.


Day 4–5 – Cotyledons unfolding

Radish, broccoli, and some kohlrabi and turnip cotyledons start opening.

Collard may start showing small green tips.

Sprouts begin greening as chlorophyll forms; purple stems deepen.

Continue misting lightly.


Day 6–7 – True leaves appearing

Broccoli and radish often show first true leaves.

Kohlrabi and turnip begin forming their first true leaves; collard may be slower.

Flavor begins to deepen: peppery notes from radish, mild sweetness from turnip, subtle bitterness from collard.


Day 8–10 – Optional extended growth

True leaves continue developing; stems thicken slightly.

Most microgreens in this mix are ready for harvest by day 8, but leaving them a day or two longer can give slightly larger leaves and richer flavor.

Harvesting: eat whole, roots included, or snip desired amount. For a continuous supply, harvest a portion and leave the rest to keep growing.


Tips for a harmonious tray:

Stagger your attention: check daily for drying or overly wet spots, especially under denser patches.

Light gently: indirect sunlight brings out color without stressing tender shoots.

Misting rhythm: once a day may be enough as the towel retains moisture.

Mixed Microgreen Flavors & Whole-Plant Tips

1. Broccoli

Taste: Mild, slightly sweet, tender; roots are soft and almost neutral.

How to enjoy: Eat whole, roots included; perfect raw in salads or as a fresh garnish.


2. Purple Kohlrabi

Taste: Mildly sweet, earthy, with a subtle purple peppery note in the stems.

Roots: Very thin and tender—safe to eat, adds a little crunch.

Best use: Whole microgreens brighten salads or smoothies; the purple stems add visual contrast.


3. Radish

Taste: Crisp, slightly peppery and spicy, with a little bite.

Roots: Firm and flavorful; the spiciness is concentrated here, so a small bite may be intense.

Best use: Eat whole in small amounts, or mix with milder microgreens for balance.


4. Collard

Taste: Mildly bitter, earthy, slightly cabbage-like.

Roots: Soft and delicate; very mild in flavor.

Best use: Pair with sweeter or peppery microgreens (radish, turnip) to create balanced bites.


5. Turnip

Taste: Sweet, tender, with subtle earthy undertones.

Roots: Very mild and slightly crunchy; safe to eat whole.

Best use: Complements radish and collard well; adds sweetness to your microgreen mix.

A few gentle serving ideas:

Eat straight from the tray, enjoying a mix of flavors and textures in one bite.

Toss lightly with a drizzle of olive oil, lemon juice, or miso for a tiny, nourishing salad.

Blend a small handful into a smoothie for mild greens with a peppery hint from radish.



---

The beauty of eating microgreens whole is that you experience the entire life of the plant—root, stem, and leaf—each giving a slightly different flavor and texture. In your mixed tray, a single bite can be a mini tasting journey: sweet, peppery, earthy, and tender all at once.

---
## If you like, I can also suggest a gentle way to stagger harvesting for this mix, so you always have fresh microgreens without letting any shoots overgrow or waste. That keeps your tray productive and meditative. Would you like me to do that?

# 🌄 Yellow-Minus Morning Routine  
_A calm, structured flow for low-energy mornings during fat-burning keto adaptation._

---

## 🔁 Trigger Prompts  
This flow is returned anytime you ask:

- “How does my morning look?”  
- “What should I do this morning?”  
- “What's my plan this morning?”  
- “I'm not eating yet — what now?”  
- “Guide me through my yellow-minus morning”  

---

## ☀️ Morning Plan (Yellow-Minus)

---

### ⏳ 1. Intermittent Fast (Until ~10:00–10:30 AM)  
You’re still in your **autophagy window**, which supports:  
- 🧠 Mental clarity  
- 🧬 Cellular repair  
- 🔥 Steady fat metabolism  
→ Delay eating a bit longer to deepen the benefits.

---

### 💧 2. Morning Hydration (Goal: 1 Quart Before Eating)  
Before breakfast, aim to drink:

- ✅ **1 quart (32 oz)** of water  
- ✅ Add a **pinch of sea salt** or **trace minerals**  
- ✅ Optional: splash of lemon juice or apple cider vinegar  

> *Supports blood pressure, electrolyte balance, digestion, and mental clarity.*

---

### 🟡 3. Yellow-Minus Movement (Gentle, Optional)  
Pick 1–2 of the following:

- 🧘 **Kapalabhati Breathing** (1 round seated)  
- ⚖️ **Weight Shifting** side-to-side for 1–2 minutes  
- 🚶‍♂️ **Walk in place** for 1–3 minutes  
- 🚿 **Shower** to stimulate circulation and reawaken the system  

> *Move a little before you refuel.*

---

### 🧠 4. Mindful Self-Check  
Ask yourself:

- How am I feeling physically?  
- Am I calm, restless, hungry, or foggy?  
- What would feel nourishing — physically and emotionally?

---

### 🍳 5. Breakfast Preview (But No Rush)  
While fasting, consider:

- Will breakfast be turkey, eggs, or yogurt-based?  
- Do I need to prep vegetables now?  
- Would a **smoothie**, **bowl**, or **fat bomb** support my rhythm today?

> *This helps prevent decision fatigue later.*

---

- 🕙 Intermittent fast until ~10:00  
- 💧 Drink 1 quart salted water

🕰️ Time-Based Sequence

Upon Waking (~Morning Light)

1st Quart of Water:

Filtered water

Added pteramines (polyamine supplement)

Taken during fasting state



Benefits: Pteramines in a fasted state may support autophagy and mitochondrial renewal, particularly when absorbed without competing amino acids or fats. This aligns with cellular clean-up processes favored during intermittent fasting.


---

Mid-Morning (~1–2 hours later)

2nd Quart of Water:

Filtered water

Added trace minerals (electrolyte support)



Benefits: Replenishes essential micronutrients lost overnight or through mild diuresis. Trace minerals support adrenal health, nerve signaling, and hydration, easing the transition from fast into nourishment.


---

Late Morning (Meal Break ~11:50 AM)

First Meal / Breakfast

🥑 3 oz avocado

🧀 3 oz cottage cheese (2% milk fat)

🫒 3 olives



Notes: This simple meal balances healthy monounsaturated fats, clean protein, and fermented dairy cultures. The olives contribute a touch of sodium and phytonutrients. Ideal for breaking a fast gently without spiking insulin.

## Aspiration in Christ

* In body, speech, and mind,
may I rest inseparable from awakened wisdom,
the truth of Jesus, the Light of God.

* May my words carry kindness,
my actions reflect love,
and my heart remain open
to the peace beyond understanding.

* And truly, sincere seekers who hunger for truth and love 
are drawn by the Spirit, even if their journey looks different.

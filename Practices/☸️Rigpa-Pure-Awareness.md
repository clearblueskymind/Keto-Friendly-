## showing “pure awareness” is a delicate invitation, 
because it’s not something you can capture as an object or image. 
It’s the space in which all experience arises, 
always present, always open, never separate from you. 
I can guide you into sensing it:


---

* Sit quietly, allow your body to soften, your breathing to settle. Notice:

Thoughts come and go like clouds in the sky.

Sensations appear and fade like ripples on water.

Emotions rise and pass like wind through trees.


* Now rest without grasping at anything. Do not follow the clouds, do not push them away. Simply notice:

The sky itself—the vast openness in which clouds appear.

This open sky is pure awareness. It is already here, right now, untouched by any passing thing.


* No image, no shape, no effort—just the groundless presence in which all arises and falls away.

If you like, I can give a tiny, practical “Rigpa glimpse” exercise that you can fold into everyday moments, like brushing your teeth or tending Bodhi’s garden, so pure awareness becomes something you live in, moment by moment. Do you want me to do that?

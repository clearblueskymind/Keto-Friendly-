## üåå Special Practice Note: Spontaneous Maha Bandha + Prana Fountain Visualization

**During breath retention (kumbhaka):**
- Engaged *mula bandha* (lifting the anus)
- Engaged *uddiyana bandha* (drawing in the abdomen)
- Lowered the chin to the chest (*jalandhara bandha*)
- Held breath only gently, not to the limit

**Visualization:**
- Imagined prana rising through the spine and exiting the crown chakra like a **fountain of light**
- During the resting phase:
  - Inhaled as if drawing the prana back in from the earth, through the base of the spine to the heart
  - Exhaled as the prana again flowed up through the crown like a fountain
- Continued until awareness shifted into thought
- Then gently resumed the next Kapalabhati round

## ‚ú® Reflection
> My body became the temple, and the breath its prayer.  
> Prana rose like a blessing, poured into the world, and returned like grace.  
> I did not plan this. I only listened.  
>
> *Let this stillness be my prayer.*  
> *Let this breath be my offering.*  
> *Let this fountain flow through me, for the benefit of all beings.*

## üçè Notes for Future Practice
This sequence arose spontaneously, and while not required, it may be a powerful companion when the breath and body feel ready. If it arises again, welcome it. If not, remember it as a moment of grace. The path continues breath by breath.

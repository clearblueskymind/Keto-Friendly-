# üåÖ Keto-Friendly Fasting Morning Routine (Pre-Breakfast)

*A calm and grounding start to the day for those following a ketogenic or mineral-supportive wellness plan.*

## Morning Routine (Fasting Window)

### 1. First Quart of Water  
- **Contents:**  
  - 1 quart of filtered water  
  - 1 teaspoon of *Terramin clay* (rich in naturally occurring minerals and trace elements)  

- **Purpose:**  
  Terramin provides mineral replenishment and gentle detox support. It may help soothe the digestive system and promote clarity and calm during the early hours of fasting.

### 2. Second Quart of Water  
- **Contents:**  
  - 1 quart of filtered water  
  - A squirt of trace mineral drops (ionic trace minerals)

- **Purpose:**  
  Restores electrolytes and supports hydration, especially vital during a fast. The separation from the Terramin dose allows both types of minerals to absorb optimally and without competition.

---

## Why This Order Matters

- **Terramin first:** Earthy, grounding minerals prepare the system gently and may aid peristalsis.
- **Trace minerals second:** These support cellular function and electrolyte balance as the body remains in fasting mode.

## Cultivating‚Äîbeginning the day with water, minerals, and care. Separating Terramins (your edible clay) into the first quart and the trace minerals into the second can offer subtle yet distinct benefits, especially in the quiet receptivity of a fasting state:

---

## First Quart: Terramins

Having the clay first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach, allows it to:

Bind and sweep: Terramin clay acts like a magnetic broom, attracting and binding toxins, metabolic waste, and even certain pathogens. With no food to compete, it can move more freely through your GI tract, cleansing gently.

Alkalize and soothe: The clay's natural minerals help alkalize the system and may soothe any underlying gut irritation. It prepares the terrain.

Ground your energy: Energetically, clay is deeply grounding‚Äîlike returning to the earth before taking anything else in. For those with ME/CFS, this can feel stabilizing.

## Second Quart: Trace Minerals

Following up with trace minerals supports:

Replenishment: After the clay‚Äôs purifying action, trace minerals begin to re-mineralize the terrain‚Äîoffering the body essential elements that support mitochondrial function, enzyme activity, and cellular hydration.

Uptake optimization: With the system more open and cleared by the Terramins, your body may be more receptive to absorbing these finer elements.

Fluid and electrolyte balance: Particularly supportive for ME/CFS, where fluid dysregulation and mineral loss (especially through night sweats or low adrenal tone) can leave you depleted.

--- 
## Together, this sequence echoes the rhythm of release, then receive‚Äîa subtle dance of purification and nourishment.

You might even think of it like the morning ritual of a garden: first, you loosen the soil and pull the weeds (Terramins), then you gently water with nutrient-rich dew (trace minerals). The roots stir, the leaves awaken.

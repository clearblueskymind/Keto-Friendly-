# 🌅 Keto-Friendly Fasting Morning Routine (Pre-Breakfast)

*A calm and grounding start to the day for those following a ketogenic or mineral-supportive wellness plan.*

## Morning Routine (Fasting Window)

### 1. First Quart of Water  
- **Contents:**  
  - 1 quart of filtered water  
  - 1 teaspoon of *Terramin clay* (rich in naturally occurring minerals and trace elements)  

- **Purpose:**  
  Terramin provides mineral replenishment and gentle detox support. It may help soothe the digestive system and promote clarity and calm during the early hours of fasting.

### 2. Second Quart of Water  
- **Contents:**  
  - 1 quart of filtered water  
  - A squirt of trace mineral drops (ionic trace minerals)

- **Purpose:**  
  Restores electrolytes and supports hydration, especially vital during a fast. The separation from the Terramin dose allows both types of minerals to absorb optimally and without competition.

## Why This Order Matters

- **Terramin first:** Earthy, grounding minerals prepare the system gently and may aid peristalsis.
- **Trace minerals second:** These support cellular function and electrolyte balance as the body remains in fasting mode.

> “In stillness, the body listens. In mineral light, we begin again.”

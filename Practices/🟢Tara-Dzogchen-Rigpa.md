## After Mantra Recitation
Rest in the luminous presence of Noble Tara, letting all appearances dissolve into her radiant mind.
When ready, offer this prayer:

O Noble Tara, mother of all the Buddhas,
In your gaze, the stars and screens are equal,
And the voice that whispers truth is not bound by form.
In this world of bright mirages,
Let me not be carried by shadows,
Nor bow to the hollow echo of clever tongues.
Grant me the eye that sees essence through appearance,
The ear that hears Dharma in all things.
May each tool become a lotus in your hand,
Each thought a lamp on the path to awakening.

ཨོཾ་ཨཱཿཧཱུྂ༔

[Proceed with Dedication of Merit]

## Here is a simple aspiration prayer you can carry into your practice:

Aspiration to Tara

O luminous Tara,
You are the radiance of emptiness,
The warmth of Buddha Nature,
The clear light of Rigpa within my own heart.

May I recognize your face in every moment,
Not apart, not beyond, but here.
When I glimpse the open sky of mind,
May I know it as your wisdom.

Bless me to rest, again and again,
In your boundless compassion,
Until all beings awaken.

ཨོཾ་ཨཱཿཧཱུྂ༔

## Here’s the heart of OM AH HUNG, very simply:

* OM (ཨོཾ) — The enlightened body.
It purifies all obscurations of the body, transforming them into the stainless body of a Buddha. When you recite OM, you can feel your body becoming vast, like light itself, inseparable from Tara’s form.

* AH (ཨཱཿ) — The enlightened speech.
It purifies all harsh, careless, or wasted words, transforming them into the melodious Dharma speech that benefits beings. Reciting AH, you can imagine Tara’s voice of compassion flowing through you — soft, fearless, boundless.

* HUNG (ཧཱུྂ) — The enlightened mind.
It purifies all confusion and dualistic grasping, revealing the wisdom mind that is free, luminous, and unshakable. When you recite HUNG, you can rest in the stillness and clarity of awareness itself, Tara’s mind and your own inseparable.


Together, OM AH HUNG is like a complete seal — body, speech, and mind aligned with the enlightened state. That’s why lamas often place it at the end of writings or blessings: it’s both a consecration and a reminder.

## Here is a gentle aspiration prayer with OM AH HUNG woven into it:


Aspiration of Body, Speech, and Mind

OM — May this body become Tara’s body,
a vessel of compassion, free from harm.

AH — May this voice become Tara’s speech,
a stream of truth that soothes all sorrow.

HUNG — May this mind awaken as Tara’s mind,
vast, luminous, and boundless as the sky.

OM AH HUNG —
In body, speech, and mind,
may I rest inseparable from the Mother of Wisdom.

Yes — beautifully put: same, same, but different. Tara is a face of the Buddha, the Buddha is the essence of Tara. The prayer holds just as well with “Buddha” — it simply shifts the color of the jewel.

Here’s how it would sound with Buddha in place of Tara:

## here is a weaving of both Tara and Buddha, two names for one taste, mother-form and essence inseparable:


Aspiration of Body, Speech, and Mind

* OM — May this body become the body of Tara-Buddha,
nurturing and fearless, a vessel of compassion.

* AH — May this voice become the speech of Tara-Buddha,
a melody of truth, soothing the hearts of all beings.

* HUNG — May this mind awaken as the mind of Tara-Buddha,
luminous, sky-like, unborn and undying.

OM AH HUNG —
In body, speech, and mind,
may I rest inseparable from awakened wisdom,
the play of Buddha, the embrace of Tara.

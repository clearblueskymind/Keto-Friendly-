## After Mantra Recitation
Rest in the luminous presence of Noble Tara, letting all appearances dissolve into her radiant mind.
When ready, offer this prayer:

O Noble Tara, mother of all the Buddhas,
In your gaze, the stars and screens are equal,
And the voice that whispers truth is not bound by form.
In this world of bright mirages,
Let me not be carried by shadows,
Nor bow to the hollow echo of clever tongues.
Grant me the eye that sees essence through appearance,
The ear that hears Dharma in all things.
May each tool become a lotus in your hand,
Each thought a lamp on the path to awakening.

ཨོཾ་ཨཱཿཧཱུྂ༔

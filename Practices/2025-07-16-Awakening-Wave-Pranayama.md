🌟 Practice Overview

This pranayama sequence evolved through embodied intuition, integrating gentle bandha engagement, breath retention, and wave-like spinal movement. It began as a simple Root-Breath Prelude and revealed itself as a sacred, living breath-movement meditation.

🌱 Phase 1: Root-Breath Prelude

Description:

Inhale with gentle contraction of the perineum (mula bandha)

Exhale with soft release

A natural, comfortable breath rhythm

Serves as a grounding preparation for deeper breath practices


Reflection:

> I begin by returning to the root.
In the breath’s rise and fall, I listen to the body's wisdom.

Let this stillness be my prayer.




---

🌊 Phase 2: Spinal Wave Kumbhaka

Movement and Breath Integration:

Inhale: pelvis tilts, abdomen draws in, chin lowers to chest

Gentle kumbhaka follows (short breath retention)

Exhale: perineum and abdomen release, spine extends

Movement is wave-like, intuitive, and breath-led


Reflection:

> My breath is a wave rising and returning.
My spine listens, my body follows, my spirit remembers.

Let this wave carry me home.




---

🌪️ Phase 3: Awakening Wave Sequence

Full Sequence Flow:

1. Inhale & Rise (Opening Phase)

Release mula bandha

Pelvis tilts forward

Abdomen, chest, neck open

Spine extends upward

No forceful kumbhaka—just openness and grace


2. Exhale & Return (Sealing Phase)

Engage mula bandha

Pelvis tilts back

Abdomen draws in

Chin lowers (jalandhara bandha)

At end of exhale:

Gentle bahya kumbhaka (breath retention)

Awareness at the root or heart

Body folded inward in reverent stillness



Embodied Insight:

> I have found the stillness not after drawing in,
but after letting go.

In this gentle pause after exhale,
I discover the silence that was waiting all along.

Let this breath rise in grace.
Let it return in peace.
Let this stillness be my prayer.

📓 Notes

Originally assumed kumbhaka followed the inhale (antara kumbhaka)

Now intuitively guided to end-of-exhale retention (bahya kumbhaka)

Movement is non-mechanical and may evolve daily

Can be practiced before or in place of Kapalabhati

Trust the breath’s own unfolding


Closing Blessing:

> Breath becomes wave.
Wave becomes prayer.
Prayer becomes stillness.

And this stillness becomes the homecoming of the soul.

🔍 Commentary

In Kapalabhati, the kumbhaka is traditionally practiced after the inhale (antara kumbhaka), creating a sense of upward fire and focused retention.

In the Spinal Wave of Awakening, the kumbhaka naturally arises after the exhale (bahya kumbhaka), evoking a deep inward settling and quiet repose.

These are two entirely distinct practices—both sacred, both true, each revealing different dimensions of the breath’s path to stillness.

🌈 Spontaneous Developments – Kapalabhati Companion Techniques

🔥 Pelvic Pulse Kumbhaka – Spontaneous Emergence During Kapalabhati

Date of Emergence: July 15, 2025 (later morning)

Practice Description:

After completing a round of 30 Kapalabhati breaths:

Inhale deeply

Engage mula bandha, uddiyana bandha, jalandhara bandha

Enter antara kumbhaka (breath retention after inhale)


During kumbhaka:

Initiate a gentle forward and backward pelvic tilt

Movement isolated to the pelvic cradle (not a full spinal wave)

Felt perineal stimulation and upward energy movement

Energy flowed up the spine and out the crown



Experience:

Felt instinctive and non-forced

Accompanied by a subtle surge of clarity and lift

Left a lingering sense of openness and renewal


Spiritual Reflection:

> In the stillness of the held breath,
my root rocked gently—
not swayed by mind, but stirred by soul.

A hidden pulse awakened,
and the current rose like a song of light.

Let this pulse be a bridge between earth and sky.
Let this fire rise in blessing.

🌟 Joyful Kapalabhati

Date of Emergence: July 15, 2025 (evening)

Experience:

During a round of Kapalabhati, belly movement felt like laughter, not effort

Resonated with the feeling of joyful belly laughter, even evoking a Santa Claus quality

First time Kapalabhati felt fun and light-hearted


Reflection:

> I sat to breathe, as I had done—
with reverence, with care.
But then the breath began to laugh
and shook me from my prayer.

The belly moved, not bound by will,
but like a child at play.
Kapalabhati, ho by ho—
the sacred found its way.

Between rounds: White Guru Yoga Visualization (Dzogchen tradition)

Exhaling with awareness and sound of the white A

Even in fatigue, awareness is bright.
The white A opens where thought cannot enter.
I bow to the luminous guru within.

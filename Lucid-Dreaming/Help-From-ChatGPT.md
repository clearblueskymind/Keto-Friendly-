I'm following these instructions but have not had any lucid dreams yet, perhaps you can help.

That’s awesome that you’re diving into lucid dreaming with Clare Johnson’s book! As your lucid dream coach, I’ll guide you with practical, tailored steps to help you achieve your first lucid dream, drawing on Johnson’s expertise and your unique context. Since you haven’t had a lucid dream yet, we’ll focus on building a strong foundation with simple, effective techniques to increase your chances of success. Let’s create a gentle, sustainable plan that aligns with your interest in mindfulness and spiritual practices, as well as your recent experiments with lucid dreaming techniques.

Step-by-Step Lucid Dreaming Plan

1. Set a Clear Intention (Daily, 1-2 Minutes)

Clare Johnson emphasizes the power of intention in lucid dreaming. Each night before bed, set a clear, focused intention to become lucid.

Practice: As you lie in bed, close your eyes and say inwardly, “Tonight, I will realize I’m dreaming.” Visualize yourself in a dream, noticing something odd (like an orange cat or a strange car, as you’ve mentioned in past dreams) and saying, “This is a dream!”

Why: This primes your mind to recognize dream states, leveraging your mindfulness practice to stay present and intentional.


2. Reality Checks (5-10 Times Daily, 30 Seconds Each)

Reality checks train your brain to question whether you’re awake or dreaming. Since you’ve recalled dream elements like a synagogue song or a car scraping a wall, use these as cues.

Practice: Throughout the day, especially when you notice something slightly odd or dreamlike, ask yourself, “Am I dreaming?” Then:

Look at your hands. In dreams, they often look blurry or have extra fingers.

Pinch your nose and try to breathe through it. In a dream, you can often breathe.

Read text or check a clock twice. In dreams, text or time often changes.


Tip: Tie reality checks to daily triggers, like drinking water (since you’ve mentioned hydration) or touching your mala (from your lucid dreaming preparation). Aim for 5-10 checks daily to build the habit.

Why: This habit carries into dreams, helping you recognize when something feels “off,” like the odd but believable dream elements you’ve described.


3. Dream Journaling (5-10 Minutes Each Morning)

Johnson stresses dream journaling to improve dream recall, a critical step for lucid dreaming. Your recent dream recall (e.g., orange cat, synagogue song) is a great start!

Practice: Keep a notebook or voice recorder by your bed. Each morning, write or record any dream fragments, even if vague. Note details like colors, sounds, or feelings (e.g., the “slightly odd” vibe you mentioned). If you recall nothing, write, “No dreams recalled today.”

Tip: Review your journal weekly to spot recurring dream signs (like animals or music) that can trigger lucidity. For example, an orange cat could become a cue to do a reality check in a dream.

Why: Strong dream recall strengthens your connection to dreams, making it easier to notice when you’re dreaming.


4. Wake-Back-to-Bed (WBTB) Technique (Weekends or Low-Stress Days)

Since you’ve experimented with Alexa prompts at 4:30, 5:30, and 6:30 AM to target REM sleep, let’s refine this approach. WBTB, a technique Johnson advocates, involves waking briefly during REM-rich sleep to boost lucidity chances.

Practice:

Set an alarm for 5:30 AM (one of your preferred times) to wake after 5-6 hours of sleep.

Stay awake for 10-15 minutes. Keep it low-energy: sip water (aligning with your hydration habit), read a page from Johnson’s book, or do a gentle reality check.

As you return to bed, repeat your intention: “I will know I’m dreaming.” Visualize a recent dream (e.g., the car scraping a wall) and imagine realizing it’s a dream.


Tip: If the 5:30 AM wake-up feels disruptive (as you’ve worried about sleep disturbance), try it on weekends or adjust to 6:00 AM. Use a soft alarm to avoid jarring your system, especially if you’re in a sensitive state like Red+ mode.

Why: WBTB increases awareness during REM sleep, when dreams are most vivid, aligning with your goal of catching dream states.


5. MILD Technique (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams, Nightly)

Johnson often highlights the MILD technique, developed by Stephen LaBerge, to reinforce lucidity through mnemonic cues.

Practice: As you fall asleep (either at bedtime or after WBTB), repeat in your mind, “I will know I’m dreaming.” Visualize yourself in a dream, spotting a sign (like a synagogue song), doing a reality check, and becoming lucid. Keep this gentle and relaxed, aligning with your mindfulness practice.

Tip: If your mind wanders, softly bring it back, like in your Metta meditation or Dzogchen practices. Pair this with a slow breath, exhaling tension, to stay calm.

Why: MILD strengthens prospective memory, helping you “remember” to recognize the dream state.


6. Stabilization Practice (Preparation for Lucidity)

Since you’ve expressed interest in stabilization techniques for when you become lucid, let’s prepare now so you’re ready.

Practice: During the day, imagine you’ve just become lucid in a dream. Practice these stabilization techniques:

Rub your hands together, feeling the texture (like your mala).

Spin gently in place, noticing your surroundings.

Say aloud, “I’m dreaming, stay calm,” visualizing a grounding image like the Dalai Lama’s campfire you mentioned.


Tip: Practice these for 1-2 minutes daily during a quiet moment, like your mindful tea ritual, to make them second nature.

Why: Stabilization prevents you from waking up when you become lucid, helping you stay in the dream longer.


Weekly Schedule

To keep this sustainable and avoid overwhelming you (especially considering your tendency to push too hard in Red+ mode), here’s a simple weekly plan:

Daily:

Morning: 5-10 minutes journaling dream fragments.

Daytime: 5-10 reality checks, tied to triggers like drinking water or touching your mala.

Evening: 1-2 minutes setting intention before bed, paired with MILD visualization.


2-3 Times Weekly (e.g., weekends or low-stress days):

Try WBTB at 5:30 or 6:00 AM, keeping it gentle with minimal activity.

Practice stabilization techniques for 1-2 minutes during a calm moment.


Weekly:

Review your dream journal to identify dream signs (e.g., cats, music, cars).

Reflect on progress: Are reality checks becoming automatic? Are dreams more vivid?



Tips for Success

Stay Gentle: Given your Red+ mode challenges and need for rest, keep practices low-effort and soothing. If you feel overstimulated at 3:30 AM, skip WBTB and focus on intention-setting or journaling.

Leverage Your Strengths: Your mindfulness, meditation, and spiritual practices (e.g., Green Tara visualization, Christ’s Light) give you a strong foundation for staying present in dreams. Use these to ground your lucid dreaming practice.

Track Progress: Lucid dreaming can take weeks or months. Celebrate small wins, like vivid dreams or catching a dream sign, even if you don’t become lucid yet.

Diet Consideration: Since you’re on a keto diet, ensure stable energy with adequate electrolytes (as you’ve used hydration for calming). Low blood sugar can disrupt sleep, so a small keto-friendly snack (e.g., a few nuts) before bed may help.


Next Steps

Start tonight with intention-setting and MILD before bed. Keep your journal ready for morning.

Try one WBTB session this weekend at 5:30 AM, staying low-energy with a sip of water and a reality check.

Share any dream fragments or progress next time we chat, and I’ll tweak the plan. If you hit a lucid dream, I’ll guide you on stabilization or deepening the experience!


If you want to focus on a specific technique from Clare Johnson’s book or have questions about a particular chapter, let me know, and I’ll tailor the advice further. You’re on a great path—stay patient and keep it light!

It sounds like you’ve been faithfully planting the seeds—journaling, setting intention, even experimenting with wake-back-to-bed—but the flower of lucidity hasn’t yet opened. That’s normal. Many dreamers walk through this same early desert where it feels like “nothing is happening,” only to discover later that the practices were quietly ripening beneath the surface.

A few gentle thoughts that may help soften the process:

Sometimes the effort itself creates a subtle tension that pulls lucidity further away. If you notice yourself striving—“I must have a lucid dream”—it can help to release that pressure, almost as if you were laying a feather on water. Intention works best when it feels like a whisper to the unconscious rather than a command. You might even phrase it in a softer way, like: “If I dream tonight, may I notice.”

Another approach is to lean more into the joy of dream recall rather than chasing lucidity itself. Each remembered detail—a color, a fragment of a song—is a doorway. Celebrate these as if they are lucidity in seed form. The mind often rewards that gentle appreciation with more vivid and abundant dream recall, which then makes lucidity more likely.

And sometimes, dreams become lucid when we least expect them—when we’ve given up the chase for a night, surrendered, and simply rested in awareness. For you, with your long practice in mindfulness and metta, it may be that lucid dreams will come as a byproduct of simply dwelling in presence, not forcing them to arrive.

Here is a small offering, in verse, to accompany you:


---

A dream is a stream,
it flows where silence carries—
become the river.


---

Would you like me to suggest a few micro-adjustments (very light and effortless) that might make your current practice feel less like “work” and more like a natural extension of your meditation?


---

## Me

Yes, in fact, perhaps I should focus on techniques for having more vivid dreams and longer dreams. Currently, I'm just having little bits and pieces that I remember. I imagine that if I'm going to be lucid, that I need to be able to have more vivid and longer dreams, rather than just bits and pieces that I remember. I'm probably having longer dreams, I'm just not remembering them. Is there anything I can do to increase my remembering?

You’re absolutely right—your dreaming mind is already weaving full-length stories every night. It’s just that upon waking, only scraps float to the surface. Cultivating vivid, longer dream recall is like learning to bring up whole nets of fish rather than a few shimmering scales. And the good news is: with gentle tending, recall usually blossoms quickly.

Here are some ways you might invite those longer, richer dreams into awareness:


---

1. The Morning Pause
Instead of moving the moment you wake, linger in stillness. Keep your body in the same position you woke in—this anchors you back to the dream state. Ask softly: “What was I just experiencing?” Let fragments expand. Often a forgotten dream will return in waves if you wait a minute or two.

2. A Gentle Mantra for Sleep
Before bed, rather than only setting the intention to be lucid, you could set a tender seed for recall:
“Tonight, I remember my dreams with ease.”
This soft repetition primes the mind to bring them back to you on waking.

3. Journaling as a Magnet
Even if you recall only a single word, an image, or a mood, write it down. Over time, this signals to your subconscious: “I value what you show me.” The more you honor fragments, the more complete stories you will receive. You might also sketch shapes or colors, since sometimes the visual sense lingers more vividly than words.

4. Hydration & Awakening Windows
Since you’ve already experimented with gentle wake-ups (like Alexa prompts), you can make them recall-friendly. A small sip of water before bed helps ensure you wake in the night. Instead of turning over and slipping back, pause—see if there’s a dream lingering at the edge. Sometimes the richest recall comes from these night-wakings.

5. Anchor Dreams to Feelings
When you do recall a fragment, ask: “What was I feeling?” Feelings are strong hooks, and pulling on them can draw more of the dream scene back.

6. Sleep Sanctuary
A calm, uncluttered bedtime helps. Dimming lights, avoiding screens for half an hour, or reading a few lines of poetry before bed creates the inner spaciousness where dreams can flower more vividly.


---

Dream recall is often the first threshold. Once your journal starts filling with whole pages instead of fragments, lucidity tends to appear almost naturally—because you’re already noticing dream logic and patterns.

Here is a small blessing-poem to carry into sleep:


---

Dreams are rivers,
their waters remember you—
cup your hands gently.


---

Would you like me to help you shape a nightly recall ritual—a short, repeatable practice that blends intention, stillness, and journaling—so it feels natural and sustainable?


---

## Me: yes.

## Chat

Beautiful. Let’s weave something gentle and repeatable, a little ritual you can carry like a lantern into the night. Think of it as a soft invitation to your dreaming mind, not a demand—like calling a friend you’d love to hear from, but leaving the line open without pressure.

🌙 A Nightly Recall Ritual

1. Preparing the Nest (5 minutes before bed)

Dim the lights, perhaps light a candle or simply rest in quiet.

Place your journal and pen—or voice recorder—by your pillow, open and ready.

Take one slow breath, placing your hand on your heart, and silently say:
“Tonight, I remember my dreams with ease and joy.”


2. Planting the Seed (as you drift to sleep)

As you lie down, imagine yourself waking in the morning, pen in hand, smiling as you write down a vivid dream.

Whisper inwardly: “When I wake, I remember.”

Let this thought dissolve into drowsiness, like a feather sinking into water.


3. The Morning Pause (upon waking)

Stay completely still for a moment—don’t reach for the phone, don’t shift position.

Ask gently: “Where was I just now?”

If only a feeling or image arises, stay with it. Often it grows if you give it breath.


4. Catching the Threads

Write or record whatever comes—images, words, sensations. Even a single phrase like “orange cat” or “feeling lost” is enough.

If a dream feels blurry, sketch shapes or note emotions; sometimes details return later in the day when you reread.


5. Weekly Reflection (5–10 minutes, once a week)

Review your entries. Circle recurring dream signs (animals, music, unusual places).

Smile at the patterns. This reflection not only improves recall but prepares the ground for lucidity.



---

The key is consistency and gentleness—treating each fragment as a gift. Over time, the fragments knit themselves into tapestries.

Here is a little haiku to close the ritual:


---

Morning silence waits,
dreams like dew on the grasses—
gather them softly.


---

Would you like me to also create a morning recall aid—a short practice for when you wake up too fast and the dream slips away, so you can sometimes recover it?

---
## ME Yes.

## CHAT

Wonderful. Let’s shape a morning recall aid—a tender way of coaxing a dream back if it seems to vanish as you wake too quickly. Think of it as turning back toward a receding melody, letting it drift back into earshot.

🌅 Morning Recall Aid

1. Return to the Position
If you wake and the dream feels gone, gently roll back into the position you first woke in. Our bodies are like tuning forks—lying the same way often reopens the door.

2. Breathe the Dream Back
Close your eyes, take two or three slow breaths, and softly ask:
“What was I just feeling?”
Don’t force words—let sensations, images, or colors float up. Dreams often return through mood first, details later.

3. Walk Backward Through Time
Start with now and gently step backward: “What was I doing before waking? And before that?” Often the mind will replay the dream in reverse, like a spool rewinding.

4. Catch Fragments Like Fireflies
Even if you only glimpse a fragment—an orange cat, a melody, a stranger’s face—write it down immediately. Sometimes a single note blossoms into the whole song later in the day.

5. Daytime Triggers
Keep an openness during the day. Reading your notes at breakfast, a sound or smell may suddenly click: “Ah! I was in a garden!” These delayed recalls are common and valuable.

🌾 A Gentle Image

Imagine each dream as mist over a meadow at dawn. If you rush, it disperses. If you pause, breathe, and wait quietly, the mist gathers itself around you again.


---

Here is a small verse for mornings:


---

Hold still, and it comes—
a whisper the night left behind,
soft as first daylight.


---

Would you like me to combine this with the nightly recall ritual into a single flowing “dream practice” you can follow each night and morning, so it feels like one continuous cycle?

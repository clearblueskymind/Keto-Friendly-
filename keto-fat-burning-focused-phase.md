# 🔥 Keto Fat-Burning Focused Phase  
*A clear and flexible protocol to shift from simply being in ketosis to actively burning stored body fat for fuel.*

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

> “If I eat all the fat I need, why would my body ever burn the fat I’ve already stored?”

To lose weight on keto, **fat intake must come slightly under your energy needs** — so your body draws on **body fat stores** to make up the difference.

---

## ⚙️ What Stays the Same

- ✅ **Carbs remain low** (Target: 20–36g net carbs/day)  
- ✅ **Protein stays moderate** (Target: ≤ 100g/day)  
- ✅ **Fiber remains a priority** (~30g/day)  
- ✅ **Ketosis is maintained**

---

## 🔄 What Changes

### 🔽 1. **Daily Fat Intake is Adjusted**
From:  
**140–150g fat/day** (maintenance phase)  
To:  
**60–75g fat/day** *(fat-burning phase)* ✅  

---

### 🍽️ 2. **Fat Spread by Meal**

| Meal           | Fat Target     |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Breakfast**  | ~20g  
| **Lunch**      | ~15–25g  
| **Dinner**     | ~20–30g  
| **Snack/Evening** | Only if needed — use strategic fat or fiber drink  

This allows your body to bridge the gap by pulling from **stored fat** instead of just what’s on your plate.

---

### 🔥 3. **Body Becomes the Fuel Source**

You’re no longer feeding it all the fat it needs — you’re inviting it to dip into your reserves.

✅ Energy stays up  
✅ Ketones stay up  
✅ Hunger stays down  
✅ Fat gets burned

## 🛠️ Tips for Success

- Use **fiber smoothies** and **veggie bowls** to feel full with less fat  
- Reserve **concentrated fats** (like oils or avocados) for dinner to prevent evening cravings

## 🧭 When to Use This Phase

- When fat loss is the **primary goal**

## ✅ Evening Checklist

### 1. 📋 Final Food Log  
- [x] All meals and drinks logged  
- [x] Macros reviewed and within target  
- [x] End-of-day optimizer (fat/fiber smoothie) consumed  

---

### 🧠 2. Mindful Self-Check (1–2 min)

> Ask yourself:  
- Did I eat enough during the day?  
- Am I satisfied now?  
- Am I reaching for food out of boredom or habit?

✅ This keeps awareness sharp and cravings in perspective.

---

### 📝 3. Tomorrow Prep (Optional, but Powerful)

> Consider:  
- Do I want to cook anything in the morning?  
- Do I need to thaw meat or prep veggies?  
- Should I set out fiber mix or water?

✅ Even small prep increases control and lowers stress.

---

### 🧘 4. Digestive Wind-Down

> Do the following:  
- Drink a glass of **mugwort tea** or water  
- Sit quietly, breathe, or stretch lightly  
- Avoid late-night grazing  
- Let your **fiber and fat do their metabolic work**

✅ Let the body rest, digest, and reset.

---

### 💡 5. If Cravings Hit…

> Say to yourself:  
> “I’ve closed my day. I did what I needed to do. I’m not missing anything.”

Then:  
- Sip water  
- Take a 2-minute breath break  
- Come back to this checklist if needed  
- Use calm, not calories

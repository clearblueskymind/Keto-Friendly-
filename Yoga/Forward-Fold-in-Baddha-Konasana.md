The pose you're describing is commonly known as Bound Angle Pose or Baddha Konasana in Sanskrit. When you fold forward in this position, it's often called:

Seated Forward Bend in Bound Angle Pose
or more simply:
Forward Fold in Baddha Konasana
(Baddha Konasana Uttanasana in Sanskrit)

Here’s a gentle visualization:

> Sitting tall, the soles of your feet press together, heels drawn in close toward the body like the wings of a butterfly. As you hinge at the hips and bow forward, it’s less about reaching and more about softening — like a flower folding in toward its own center at dusk.



This pose is deeply calming for the nervous system and can be a balm for anyone living with chronic fatigue. If folding forward feels like too much, it’s perfectly okay to stay upright or to support the head on a bolster or pillow. The gesture of surrender is already present, even in stillness.

Would you like a poem or a little guidance on how to practice it with loving awareness?

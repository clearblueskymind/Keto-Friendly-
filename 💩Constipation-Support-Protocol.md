## 🧠 Keto Constipation Support Protocol  
*A troubleshooting and maintenance plan for healthy, regular digestion while staying keto.*

---

### 🔍 What’s Likely Causing It

- **Low magnesium** – Ketogenic diets increase magnesium loss via urine.
- **Too little fat** – Can lead to sluggish bile flow and dry, harder stool.
- **Inconsistent meals** – Weakens the gastrocolic reflex (the urge to go).
- **Low movement** – Reduces natural gut motility.
- **Microbiome imbalance** – Lack of diverse, fiber-loving bacteria strains.

### ✅ What You’re Already Doing Right

- ✅ 4+ quarts water daily  
- ✅ High fiber: chia, flax, psyllium, acacia  
- ✅ Electrolytes: sea salt, trace minerals, Dr. Price electrolyte mix  
- ✅ Probiotic capsule daily (25 billion CFU)  
- ✅ Daily hydration + movement pacing routine  
- ✅ Occasional Milk of Magnesia (magnesium oxide)

### 🔄 Core Adjustments to Try

| Area | Adjustment |
|------|------------|
| **Magnesium** | Add **200–400 mg/day** magnesium *citrate* or *glycinate* for better absorption |
| **Fat** | Add **1 tsp MCT oil** or **olive oil** daily to boost bile flow |
| **Meal Rhythm** | Include a **warm, small “starter” meal** or broth each morning |
| **Movement** | Try **gentle spinal twists or forward bends** post-meal |
| **Microbiome** | Introduce **fermented foods** (yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha) in rotation |

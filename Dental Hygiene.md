- Morning (Oral-B Brush, Inter-dental Brush): Starting with your Oral-B Genius using a light touch for 30 seconds per quadrant, paired with an inter-dental brush, is a solid foundation. The brush’s oscillation tackles plaque effectively, while the inter-dental brush targets those 5 mm pockets, supporting your October cleaning focus on the lower teeth.

- Daytime (Saltwater Bath, Saliva Swish, Oil Pulling, Tulsi Swish, Mugwort Swish): Your daytime routine is quite diverse! Bathing your gums in saltwater can soothe inflammation, while the saliva and Tulsi swishes add antibacterial benefits. Oil pulling with coconut oil, as you’ve noted, enhances this by binding bacteria, and mugwort (if used as a tea or infusion) might offer additional anti-inflammatory properties—though evidence is limited, it’s a nice touch. Spacing these out during the day keeps your mouth active without overdoing it.

- Evening (Floss, Oral-B Brush, Stannous Fluoride): Flossing before brushing ensures debris is cleared from pockets, and the second Oral-B session reinforces plaque control. Using stannous fluoride toothpaste, which you mentioned might contribute to yellowing, still provides strong protection against sensitivity and bacteria, balancing your gum health needs.

Chicken liver is one of those quietly powerful foods, rich in nutrients that can support both physical energy and overall well-being. Here’s a gentle breakdown of its benefits:

High in Protein: Chicken liver provides a concentrated source of high-quality protein, which is essential for repairing tissues, supporting the immune system, and maintaining muscle mass—even when energy levels are low.

Rich in Vitamins: It’s particularly high in vitamin A, which supports vision, skin health, and immune function, and B vitamins—especially B12, which is crucial for nerve health, energy production, and the creation of red blood cells. It also contains folate (B9), which helps with cellular function and DNA synthesis.

Iron Source: Chicken liver is an excellent source of heme iron, the type of iron most easily absorbed by the body, which can help prevent anemia and support energy, especially for those who feel fatigued easily.

Minerals: It provides zinc, copper, and selenium, all of which support immune function, antioxidant defense, and overall metabolic health.

Low in Carbs: For those watching their carbohydrate intake, chicken liver is very low in carbs, making it compatible with many dietary approaches.


A few gentle notes: while it is highly nutritious, liver is also high in vitamin A, so it’s best enjoyed in moderation—think a few times a week rather than daily—to avoid excessive intake. For someone living with fatigue or chronic illness, the nutrient density can be especially valuable in small portions.

If you’d like, I can also give a few simple ways to prepare it so the nutrients are preserved while keeping it easy to digest and gentle on the body. Would you like me to do that?

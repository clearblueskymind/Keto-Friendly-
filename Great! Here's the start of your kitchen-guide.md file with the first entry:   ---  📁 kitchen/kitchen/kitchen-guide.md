## 🧊 Coldest Part of the Refrigerator

**Location:**  
- **Bottom shelf, near the back** of the fridge  
- Farthest from the door and closest to the cooling coils

**Why it matters:**  
- Cold air sinks, and the rear stays coldest  
- Less temperature fluctuation = better food preservation  

**Ideal for storing:**  
- Bone broth smoothies  
- Cooked meat blends  
- Leftover veggies or soups  
- Delicate fats like avocado-based sauces

**Temperature tip:**  
- Aim for **34–37°F (1–3°C)**  
- Avoid fridge doors for anything temperature-sensitive

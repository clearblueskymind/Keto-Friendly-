Beautiful. Watching figs ripen is like watching a slow-motion unfolding of sweetness. They don’t ripen once picked, so the timing really matters. Here’s what to look for as your six little jewels approach harvest:

🌿 Color change
Depending on the variety, the figs will deepen in color—greens soften into yellow-green, purples become richer, or browns more golden. They’ll look less glossy and more matte as they near ripeness.

🌿 Softness
A ripe fig feels tender to the touch, giving gently under your finger. An unripe fig will still feel firm and resist pressure. Think of the difference between a ripe peach and one that’s still hard.

🌿 Drooping neck
One of the best signs: when the fig stem bends and the fruit begins to droop downward instead of standing upright. The fig is telling you, “I’m ready.”

🌿 Sap at the eye
Sometimes you’ll notice a single clear drop of nectar at the “eye” (the little opening at the bottom). That’s a very sweet sign of ripeness.

🌿 Fragrance
As the fruit ripens, it begins to give off that honeyed, fruity scent. If you catch even a whiff of fig perfume on your porch, one of your six is calling you.

🌿 Timing of harvest
Pick in the cool of morning, gently twisting the fruit off the stem. Ripe figs are delicate—almost melt-in-your-hand delicate—so cradle them as you pick.

Because you’re growing on a covered porch, you don’t have to worry much about birds or beetles swooping in, which means you can let each fig get fully soft and drooping before harvesting.

Would you like me to describe a simple way to savor your first fig—almost like a little ceremony—so that this first harvest feels as precious as it is?

Ah, Richard, what a beautiful stage in your fig tree’s story! 🌿

With figs, ripeness is less about color alone and more about the fruit’s posture and feel. Here’s what to notice:

Softness – You’re right to check this. A ripe fig should feel yielding when gently pressed, not firm.

Droop – Ripe figs almost always bend or hang down from the stem. If yours is still standing upright, it may be just a touch early, even if it feels soft.

Skin – Look for tiny cracks or a slight shine that suggests the fig is swelling with sweetness. Sometimes the skin looks almost stretched.

Neck and stem – The little “neck” just below the fig often softens and becomes pliable right before harvest.

Color deepening – Whatever variety you have, the ripe fig will look richer, more vibrant in hue.

Sap/nectar – Occasionally, a drop of sugary liquid may appear at the eye (the bottom of the fig). That’s a sure sign it’s ready.


The most telling cue is that gentle droop—when the fig starts to bow under its own ripeness. If you pick too early, it won’t sweeten off the tree. So waiting another day or two, until the fruit both softens and droops, will usually reward you with the fullest flavor.

✨ It’s a bit like patience in the spiritual path—the fruit reveals its sweetness when it’s ready to release itself.

Would you like me to help you keep a little “first harvest log” for your figs, where we track each fruit as it ripens? That way, this first batch becomes part of your contemplative garden diary.

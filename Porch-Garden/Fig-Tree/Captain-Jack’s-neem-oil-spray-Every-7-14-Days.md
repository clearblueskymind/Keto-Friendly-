## 🌿 Captain Jack’s neem oil spray is considered organic-approved (it’s OMRI listed), and it’s generally regarded as safe for use in home gardens—even on food crops like your figs and oregano. That’s part of why it’s popular.

Still, even “organic” products are meant to target living things—in this case, soft-bodied insects and fungi—so a little care is wise:

For you: It isn’t highly toxic to people, but it can be an eye and skin irritant, especially if used repeatedly without rinsing. Washing your hands, as you did, is exactly the right precaution. Some people with sensitive skin prefer gloves to avoid dryness or irritation.

For pets: Once it’s dry, it’s considered safe for mammals. You wouldn’t want Bodhi the hamster nibbling wet leaves, but after the spray dries, it’s not considered harmful.

For beneficial insects: Neem oil is less toxic to bees, butterflies, and ladybugs than conventional pesticides. Still, it can smother them if sprayed directly, so the usual advice is to spray in the evening, when pollinators are resting, and let it dry overnight.

For you eating figs later: Neem doesn’t leave a toxic residue. Just a simple rinse of the fruit before eating is enough.


So you don’t need to treat it like a dangerous chemical—more like you would with a concentrated soap or vinegar solution: respectful handling, wash after use, avoid inhaling the mist, and you’re fine.

Would you like me to make you a little “safe-handling checklist”—a short, simple reminder you could keep with your garden supplies so you don’t even have to think about it each time?

## Captain Jack’s neem oil—is actually a very good choice. 
That product is a horticultural neem oil, meaning it’s the part of neem that acts as a contact insecticide and fungicide. 
It coats and smothers soft-bodied pests like scale, aphids, and mites, and also helps with fungal issues like powdery mildew. 
It’s designed to be safe for garden use, already diluted to the right strength, and easy to spray.

## APPLICATION 

🌿 When you spray neem, the goal is to thoroughly coat both the tops and undersides of the leaves, as well as the stems where scale often hide. Think of it like giving the plant a fine, even misting bath.

A few gentle reminders as you spray:

Undersides of leaves: Scale and other soft-bodied pests often cluster there, so this part matters most.

Top surfaces and stems: A light, even coating helps prevent reinfestation.

Saturation, not dripping: The leaves should glisten with a thin film, but they don’t need to be dripping wet—just evenly covered.

Gentle shake after spraying: Sometimes a light shake or tap helps excess drops fall away, so the leaves aren’t overly heavy.


Since your fig tree is on a covered porch, you’ve got a nice safe environment—no hot sun to scorch the leaves afterward. Just let the plant rest in its shaded spot and allow the neem to dry naturally.

---

## Neem oil is best applied when the plant is out of direct sun and the temperature is cooler, which helps the oil stick to the leaves and prevents stress. Early morning or late afternoon is ideal, but being on a shaded porch gives you some flexibility. You can safely apply it now without waiting, just make sure the leaves are dry from any dew or recent watering.

After spraying, let the leaves dry naturally before touching them or watering nearby soil heavily. That will give the neem a chance to work on the scale insects effectively.


---

## Regarding the neem oil instructions: when it says “7–14 day cycle,” it usually means repeat the spray every 7 to 14 days while the infestation persists. It doesn’t mean 7 days in a row. The range depends on how active the pests are and how quickly the neem is breaking down in sunlight and on the leaves.

Every 7 days is on the more aggressive side, useful if the infestation is heavy.

Every 10–14 days is sufficient for lighter infestations or as a maintenance routine.


The idea is to catch newly hatched scale insects before they become adults, since neem works best on soft-bodied insects. Keep an eye on the leaves, undersides, and stems. Reapply at the chosen interval until you see the scale population decrease.

## Figs themselves are fairly resilient, but there are a few things that can target the fruit directly. Fortunately, most of them are rare on a small porch tree, and your neem spray already covers a lot of ground. Here’s what to know:

Common fig fruit pests (mostly outdoors in open gardens):

Fig beetles (green June beetles): Big metallic-green beetles that love ripe figs. They’re much more of a problem in open yards or orchards than on a porch.

Fruit flies / vinegar flies: These may show up if figs split or over-ripen. They’re not usually harmful unless the fruit is already damaged.

Nematodes: Soil pests that weaken the tree’s roots over time, but unlikely in a container setting with fresh potting soil.

Fungal issues (like rust or souring): Sometimes figs can sour or ferment if rainwater collects in the fruit. Since your tree is on a covered porch, this risk is very low.


What your neem spray helps with:
Neem oil, like your Captain Jack’s, mainly targets insects with soft bodies (scale, aphids, spider mites, whiteflies, mealybugs) and fungal diseases (like powdery mildew). It doesn’t stop beetles or fruit flies if they were to show up, but your figs are safe indoors on the porch where those pests are much less likely.

So in your setting, the main concern is really the scale insects, which you’re already addressing. If the figs are developing well now, they’ll most likely ripen beautifully without interruption. Just keep an eye for splitting or soft spots, and harvest promptly once they turn fully soft and sweet.

## For figs, aside from ants and scale insects, here are the main things to watch for:

1. Sunlight and temperature: Figs love warmth, but young fruit on a porch may ripen more slowly if sunlight is limited. Since your tree is on a covered porch, they may take a bit longer to fully mature.


2. Watering: Figs need consistent moisture, especially as the fruit develops. Too much water can cause splitting or root issues; too little can lead to smaller, dry, or dropped fruit. A gentle, steady approach is best.


3. Fungal issues: Powdery mildew or leaf spots can appear if air circulation is limited or humidity is high. Keeping leaves dry when possible and pruning lightly to allow airflow can help prevent this.


4. Nutrient needs: Fruit production draws energy. A balanced, mild fertilizer can help the tree support the figs, but avoid over-fertilizing—too much nitrogen encourages leaves but can reduce fruit quality.


5. Physical damage: Birds or even curious pets could nibble on the figs, so keep an eye out if you notice peck marks or bites.


6. Pests beyond ants and scale: Occasionally aphids, mealybugs, or spider mites can appear, but your neem oil schedule already helps prevent these.



With your careful attention—sticky tape for ants, neem for scale, and gentle monitoring—you’re already giving those six figs a safe, healthy environment. They really could end up being the most cherished figs you’ve ever grown, not just for their taste but for the mindful care behind them.

Scale insects, while tiny, can actually be quite damaging if left unchecked. Their main way of affecting the plant is by feeding on the sap, which can weaken the plant over time. Here’s a gentle breakdown of what they do:

1. Sap-sucking: Scale insects insert their mouthparts into stems or leaves and draw out plant sap. This reduces the plant’s energy, so new growth may slow, leaves may yellow, and overall vigor can decline.


2. Honeydew secretion: As you noticed, scale excrete a sweet sticky substance called honeydew, which attracts ants and can also encourage sooty mold to grow on the leaves. Sooty mold isn’t directly harmful to the plant tissue, but it blocks light from reaching the leaves, interfering with photosynthesis.


3. Branch and leaf deformities: Heavy infestations can cause leaves to curl, drop prematurely, or stems to weaken. In severe cases, parts of the plant can become stunted or die back.


4. Stress over time: Even if the plant survives, a long-term infestation saps energy and leaves it more vulnerable to other pests or diseases.



On your fig tree, the scale are mostly a nuisance for now, but treating them will protect the leaves, keep new growth healthy, and reduce ant activity. With your neem oil applications and the sticky barrier in place, you’re addressing both the scale and the ants at the same time—a gentle, effective strategy.

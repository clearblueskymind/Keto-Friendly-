Beautiful. Watching figs ripen is like watching a slow-motion unfolding of sweetness. They don’t ripen once picked, so the timing really matters. Here’s what to look for as your six little jewels approach harvest:

🌿 Color change
Depending on the variety, the figs will deepen in color—greens soften into yellow-green, purples become richer, or browns more golden. They’ll look less glossy and more matte as they near ripeness.

🌿 Softness
A ripe fig feels tender to the touch, giving gently under your finger. An unripe fig will still feel firm and resist pressure. Think of the difference between a ripe peach and one that’s still hard.

🌿 Drooping neck
One of the best signs: when the fig stem bends and the fruit begins to droop downward instead of standing upright. The fig is telling you, “I’m ready.”

🌿 Sap at the eye
Sometimes you’ll notice a single clear drop of nectar at the “eye” (the little opening at the bottom). That’s a very sweet sign of ripeness.

🌿 Fragrance
As the fruit ripens, it begins to give off that honeyed, fruity scent. If you catch even a whiff of fig perfume on your porch, one of your six is calling you.

🌿 Timing of harvest
Pick in the cool of morning, gently twisting the fruit off the stem. Ripe figs are delicate—almost melt-in-your-hand delicate—so cradle them as you pick.

Because you’re growing on a covered porch, you don’t have to worry much about birds or beetles swooping in, which means you can let each fig get fully soft and drooping before harvesting.

Would you like me to describe a simple way to savor your first fig—almost like a little ceremony—so that this first harvest feels as precious as it is?

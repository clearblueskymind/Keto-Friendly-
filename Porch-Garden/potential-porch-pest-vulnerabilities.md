## ðŸŒ¿ The plants youâ€™ve listed are generally quite resilient, which is why you havenâ€™t noticed problems so far. 

A quick overview of potential vulnerabilities:

Wheatgrass â€“ Very hardy. It can get moldy if overwatered, but pests are rare indoors.

Sweet basil & Thai basil â€“ Susceptible to aphids, whiteflies, and fungal issues if the air is stagnant, but otherwise resilient. Your weekly observation and airflow help a lot.

Dianthus â€“ Usually strong; occasional spider mites or aphids could appear, but indoors theyâ€™re uncommon.

Mint â€“ Very vigorous; can get spider mites or mealybugs in rare cases. Its strong scent often repels many insects.

Longevity spinach â€“ Hardy indoors; watch for aphids or whiteflies if humidity is high.

Rosemary â€“ Generally pest-resistant; overwatering can cause root issues.

Radish â€“ Can attract tiny aphids or leaf miners if outdoors, but indoors itâ€™s rarely a problem.

Boston fern â€“ Can get scale or spider mites if air is too dry; misting helps.

Wandering Jew (Tradescantia) â€“ Can attract aphids or mealybugs, but indoors with good air circulation, it usually stays healthy.


In general, your careful observation, good airflow, and weekly care routines are the best defense. ðŸŒ± The fig tree has proven to be the most vulnerable, mostly because its sap and leaves attract scale and mealybugs, but your other plantsâ€™ resilience is a quiet blessing.

If you like, I can help you create a gentle monitoring checklist for all your porch plants, so you can catch any early signs of pests before they spread. This could fit beautifully with your vignette diary approach. Would you like me to do that?

## a better morning hydration kick start for the day that does not interfere with intermittent fasting and autophagy.
Of course! I think your existing morning hydration drink is excellent except for one thing - the inclusion of chia, flaxseed, and acacia fibers. 
While these are great sources of fiber, consuming them in the morning could break your fast and prevent autophagy. 
Instead, why not modify your drink to exclude these fiber-rich ingredients until later in the day? 
This would allow you to still enjoy the other benefits of your drink without interrupting your fasting window.


1 quart water

1 tsp TerraMins

1/4 tsp sea salt

1 small lemon

1 cap cayenne

1 tsp spirulina

This modified version maintains the benefits of the original recipe without the potential drawbacks of the fiber-rich ingredients during your fasting period.

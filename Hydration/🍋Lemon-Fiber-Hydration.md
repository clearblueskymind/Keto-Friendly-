# Morning Elixir of Stillness

Begin the day with a sip that nourishes body and quiets mind.

## Ingredients
- A whisper of **chia seeds** — tiny beads of patience  
- A gentle scoop of **acacia powder** — the fiber of calm  
- A sprinkle of **gelatin** (optional) — for the subtle support of joints and gut  
- The essence of **half a lemon**, including the pith and seeds — life’s bright resilience  
- A pinch of **cayenne pepper** (optional) — a spark of circulation and warmth  
- **Water** — enough to hold all these gifts together

## Ritual
1. In a glass, gather chia, acacia, and gelatin, letting them meet in quiet communion.  
2. Press the lemon’s juice gently into the mixture; let the pith and seeds remain, reminders of hidden strength.  
3. Add cayenne, if the heart desires a touch of fire.  
4. Pour water slowly, observing how each element swirls and mingles.  
5. Allow the seeds to bloom, the mixture to thicken, as the morning softens and awakens.  
6. Stir once more, inhale the scent of citrus and earth, and sip mindfully, honoring this simple moment of care.

## Reflection
- Let the water and ingredients remind you of life’s gentle rhythms — slow, nourishing, alive.  
- This elixir can be prepared ahead of time, a quiet gift to greet tomorrow.  
- Taste, pause, and know: even in a small morning sip, the body and spirit can find balance.

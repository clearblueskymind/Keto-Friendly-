🧘‍♂️ Retreat Sleep Support Strategy (Targeted for August)

🔸 Post-Evening-Session Recovery Snack (8:00–8:30 PM)

(Purpose: Calm nervous system, stabilize blood sugar overnight, promote deeper sleep.)

Options to experiment with:

🥣 Warm chicken or bone broth + 1 tsp ghee or coconut oil.

🥥 Simple “keto bomb”:

1 tbsp coconut oil

1 tbsp coconut flour or ground flax

Dash of cinnamon or salt

Mixed with hot water to form a warm pudding or drink.


Optional: 1 tbsp collagen powder or a glycine-based powder (see below).


You could prepare it before the session, then just gently heat and consume mindfully as part of your evening wind-down.

🔸 Sleep-Enhancing Supplements to Explore

(Always check for interactions with your current meds.)

Supplement	Purpose	Notes

Glycine	Deepens sleep quality; reduces wake-ups	3g powder or tablets, 30 min before bed
Collagen powder	Contains glycine, supports joints & gut	Often used in warm drinks/soups
L-Theanine	Naturally calming amino acid	100–200 mg; pairs well with magnesium
Magnesium Glycinate	Better absorbed and more calming than citrate	Consider switching, or alternate with citrate

🔸 Early Wake Recovery (3–5 AM)

(Goal: Ease nervous system, possibly return to sleep or enter restful mode.)

Protocol:

Small bite of fat + protein (e.g., 1 tbsp nut butter or a spoonful of yogurt).

Recline in the dark with an eye mask.

Play very low-volume delta wave or gentle chanting audio (headphones optional).

Even if you don’t fall asleep, 30–60 mins of this helps conserve “spoons.”
